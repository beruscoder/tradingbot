A,2025-07-17,US,"TSMC just crushed Q2. Here‚Äôs why I‚Äôm still holding (and glad I bought the dip at $145) I‚Äôve had TSM in the portfolio for a while now (wrote a deep dive on it ages ago which still holds up). Earlier this year, when everyone freaked out over tariffs and the stock dipped to \~$145, I flagged it as a chance to load up. I bumped it to over 5% of the portfolio.

Fast forward to Q2 2025 earnings ‚Ä¶yeah. No regrets.

The numbers slapped:

* Revenue: $31.67B, up 54% YoY ü§Ø
* Net income: $9.2B, up 60%
* EPS: $2.47 (beat by $0.16)
* Gross margin: 58.6% (up big from 54.1%)
* Full-year revenue growth now expected to hit 30% (up from 20% earlier)

The stock popped. And it should‚Äôve.

What‚Äôs driving it? AI. Lots of it.

TSMC‚Äôs HPC segment now makes up 60% of total revenue. That‚Äôs up from 52% last year. Meanwhile, smartphones are just 27% of the pie now.

The 3nm node is 24% of wafer revenue already. That‚Äôs up from 15% last quarter. Nvidia, AMD, Apple, etc. are all over it. The 5nm node is still king (36%), but 3nm is catching up fast.

Revenue from the U.S. now makes up 75% of total sales. China? Just 9%. So much for ‚Äúdependence on China.‚Äù

Earnings call had some juicy bits too:

Biggest Q&A themes were:

1. Can TSM actually keep up with all this AI demand?
2. When are AI customers moving to bleeding-edge nodes like 2nm and A16?

Management basically said: yes, fabs are ramping, we‚Äôre good. And yes, AI clients are *absolutely* moving to the newest stuff sooner due to power efficiency. These data centers eat electricity like crazy. CEO said the biggest constraint for AI players is power. A16 (coming 2026) is supposed to be 20% more efficient than 2nm, which already beats 3nm.

Also, about 30% of their future advanced node capacity will be in Arizona, not Taiwan. That‚Äôs a pretty clear signal they‚Äôre hedging geo risks.

Couple other things:

* Q3 rev guide: $31.8B to $33B.
* FX headwinds (strong NT$) hit margins a bit, but they still see 53%+ long-term gross margins.
* Capex for 2025: \~$40B.
* They called out tariffs and weak consumer markets as risks, but AI growth more than offsets that

If you  want more details on my TSM thesis, I wrote a full deep dive back in March (with way more context, valuation, risks, etc):

But, more broadly, is the market just going to ignore that the current average effective tariff rate is already at about 20%?  Even if Trump doesn't follow-through with these new tariffs, are the effects of the current tariffs already in place truly ""priced in?""

Business: 

The company designs Systems-on-Chips for a broad range of applications. Broadband, wireless, infrastructure, and industrial/multi-market are the key segments. The technology MXL designs is sold to original equipment makers, majority of which are located in Asia. The technology is manufactured by TSMC and another company based out of Singapore (if I recall correctly). 

Semi-Shortage and the After Effects:

During the semiconductor shortage in 2020 and 2021, MXL saw a mass influx of cash, recording massive profits the company hadn‚Äôt seen before. Share value 5x‚Äôd from May of 2020 to December of 2021, peaking at around $75. Once the shortage subsided, customer inventories remained high, and MaxLinear suffered as a result, going from an EPS of $4.23 in 2022 to $1.10 in 2023 and even lower to -$0.90 in 2024. Share valued tanked, and recently hit 10 year lows in April of less than $10.

So What‚Äôs the Good News?

On Wednesday, July 23rd, the company is set to announce Q2 earnings. The expectation is an EPS of $0.02, a positive number the company hasn‚Äôt seen since 2023, and a positive free cash flow. Along with a return to profitability, the company is also scoring key design wins and deals that are going to (hopefully)have strong effects on the second half of the year, with the current Q4 EPS estimates sitting in between $0.15 and $0.22. The company‚Äôs Q1 earnings call gave very positive sentiment and signs, and I believe the company is set up for success in todays world of dependency on semiconductors.

Downsides:

The company had 10 customers account for 60% of revenue in 2024, and has been fighting some litigation over a terminated merger from a couple years ago. If the company fails to post solid numbers next week, share price will drop pretty hard, as it‚Äôs been climbing a lot since April (up over 50%). 

My Final Opinion: 

I believe that MaxLinear is undervalued, and should the company be able to record strong growth and numbers throughout the rest of the year, the company will be a solid investment for either the short or long term. With a current share value of $16.20, I believe the price will break $20 in the coming months, so long as the earnings report next Wednesday goes well enough. 

Current Position:
464 shares (~$7.5K) at an average cost basis of $14.93

I didn‚Äôt want to get too deep and bore people with numbers, but the company has a solid balance sheet and isn‚Äôt drowning in any debt. I wanted to keep this relatively short and sweet while getting enough info out there.

Best of luck and happy earnings season!!

A,2025-07-20,US,"Nvidia Will Continue Controlling The AI Board Nvidia is the 'queen' of the AI ecosystem, dominating hardware, software, and systems and controlling key segments from training to inference and networking.

Unmatched AI leadership, explosive revenue growth, and strategic partnerships with players like Astera Labs, Credo, and Super Micro Computer reinforce Nvidia's central role.

China market access and the Omniverse platform provide significant new growth drivers, supporting a strong 12-24 month growth outlook and a buy rating.

Despite high absolute valuation multiples, Nvidia's rapid growth and favorable PEG ratios make it attractive versus peers; the main risk is US-China geopolitical tension.

I believe these companies are well-positioned in the AI ecosystem, but I realise that one piece is missing: the queen. Just like in a game of chess, the queen is the most powerful and versatile piece on the board. It can move in any direction (horizontal, vertical, and diagonal) and quickly cover a wide area. That is why I believe it is a perfect fit for NVIDIA (NVDA). I say this because it dominates both offensively and defensively. Just as the queen controls most of the board, NVDA controls the most valuable parts of the AI infrastructure, from training to inference, simulation, and networking. Secondly, it is versatile and critical because it spans hardware, software, and systems. This is cool because few participants can match its breadth and influence. Finally, it leverages strategic partnerships. I mean, just as the queen commands pawns, rooks, and bishops, NVDA integrates system builders (such as Super Micro Computer (SMCI)), connectivity providers (such as Credo Technology Group (CRDO) and Astera Labs (ALAB)), and government AI programmes to expand its control over the AI battlefield.

So why is the queen so special?

Well, several factors set Nvidia apart. First and foremost, it holds an unparalleled leadership position in the AI field, thanks to the combination of hardware, software, and ecosystem advantages. Its Blackwell GPU architecture makes it uniquely special. Combined with the Omniverse simulation platform, we are driving self-reinforcing AI, which is driving explosive growth. For example, in the first quarter of the 2026 fiscal year, NVDA achieved revenue of $44.1 billion, representing a year over year increase of 69%. Data centre revenue reached $39.1 billion, up 73%. Some of Nvidia's key customers such as Microsoft , Google  OpenAI, and Meta  deploy tens of thousands of Nvidia's latest GPUs each quarter. For example, according to SA Weebler Finance data, hyperscale data centre operators are running approximately 1,000 NVLink rack systems (about 72,000 GPUs) per week, with further increases expected. Ideally, this means Nvidia's data centre run rate in the AI computing sector has exceeded $170 billion annually.

Secondly, NVDA's stack is also expanding beyond GPUs. As I mentioned, its global industrial simulation platform is now being used to digitise entire factories and cities. In fact, the platform has evolved to support critical infrastructure. Original equipment manufacturers like BMW are running over 30 virtual factories on the platform to optimise production in advance. As each AI solution requires an increasing amount of synthetic training data, NVDA's end-to-end solutions form an unparalleled moat. Ideally, this platform means more users generating more simulation data, ultimately driving demand for more Nvidia computing resources. What I see is that NVDA is now at the centre of the AI value chain.

Finally, the U.S. has approved the resumption of exports of NVIDIA H20 AI GPUs to China. This means NVIDIA will be able to access China's potential market, which is significant. According to a Morgan Stanley report, China's AI market is expected to reach $1.4 trillion by 2030.

China has been systematically implementing a long-term strategy to build its domestic artificial intelligence capabilities. Its strong academic foundation, innovative methods, data, talent, and growing foreign investment are driving it toward becoming a leading artificial intelligence powerhouse...

‚Äò...China is less concerned with building the most powerful AI capabilities and more focused on bringing AI to market. China embraces open-source AI, while the United States appears to be moving toward closed, tightly controlled AI systems...‚Äô

‚Äò...The next 6 to 12 months will be a critical period for Chinese AI companies, as more and more deployments aimed at solving real-world problems begin to demonstrate productivity gains.‚Äô

Due to this milestone, NVDA's Jensen Huang estimates that NVDA's potential market size  in China will reach $50 billion. This means that China's spending on AI will increase, and Nvidia's growth prospects are expected to be stronger than ever before. I expect this growth outlook to be reflected in the upcoming quarterly earnings report to be released on 27 August 2025.

These factors combined will undoubtedly accelerate Nvidia's growth trajectory over the next 12 to 24 months. Therefore, I assign a ‚ÄòBuy‚Äô rating to Nvidia Corporation.

Nvidia's AI Ecosystem

Having highlighted the case for NVDA, I would like to connect it to some AI components I have researched previously. Some of these AI companies have remarkable growth prospects and are expected to align their growth trajectories with NVDA. Additionally, the connections between NVDA and these AI companies will help us better understand NVDA's future direction.

First, Astera Labs  is a leading connectivity chip company that recently went public in 2024. ALAB's chips support scalable and low-latency GPU rack interconnects. For more information on Astera Labs and its chips, please refer to Article 1 and Article 2. Now, Nvidia has publicly announced its collaboration with Astera on NVLink Fusion. This collaboration expands NVDA's total addressable market (TAM).

There is also Credo Technology, which is known for its active cables  re-timers, and SerDes chips. According to SA Oakoff Investments, most hyperscale computing vendors now consider CRDO's AEC to be the de facto standard for in-rack links. This means that AEC cables are the infrastructure required for NVDA's 72-GPU Blackwell rack.

Third, Super Micro Computer  and Celestica  manufacture and sell GPU racks and systems using NVDA technology. Nvidia currently provides complete data centre racks containing tens of thousands of GPUs, which are delivered to system builders like SMCI and CLS. They then collaborate with NVDA to package and sell these racks to hyperscale customers such as Microsoft, Meta, and Amazon. For more information, please refer to this article from SMCI and this article from Celestica.

In summary, these partnerships demonstrate NVIDIA's connectivity within the AI ecosystem. This confirms that NVIDIA is indeed the queen of the AI chessboard.

For a company with a market capitalisation of 4.22 trillion dollars, it still has significant growth opportunities, particularly in the Chinese market, which means there is much to watch for with NVIDIA. Additionally, I note that NVIDIA has an A- growth rating, as shown in the figure below. The company's expected revenue growth rate is 60.71%, while the industry median is 7.28%. Furthermore, its 3-5 year compound annual growth rate  for expected long-term earnings per share  growth is 29.09%, compared to the industry median of 14.29%. This clearly indicates the expected growth levels for certain potential AI opportunities, such as the Omniverse platform and the Chinese AI market.

Now, when it comes to valuation, the growth outlook is becoming clearer. First, when I look at the chart below, I notice that most metrics are above the industry median, indicating that the valuation is higher than the industry median. Its non-GAAP forward price-to-earnings ratio is 40.12 times, and its forward enterprise value to EBITDA ratio is 34.79 times, both significantly higher than the industry median. However, when I look at the non-GAAP forward price-to-earnings ratio , it indicates that the valuation is undervalued by 27%. NVDA's price-to-earnings ratio is 1.38 times, while the industry median is 1.90 times. Based on the GAAP trailing 12-month PEG, the company's P/E ratio is 0.69 times, undervalued by 31% compared to the industry median. Ideally, I would say that most multiples look high in absolute terms, but compared to NVDA's 60.71% compound annual growth rate, the stock's valuation isn't as high as it appears.

In terms of peer comparison, I chose NVDA's closest competitors because Nvidia is already far ahead in terms of market capitalisation, so I chose Broadcom and AMD. I noticed that NVDA's price-to-earnings ratio and expected price-to-earnings ratio are still lower than its peers.

I believe that the biggest risk facing NVIDIA at present is geopolitical risk. Currently, there are many uncertainties between China and the United States, especially following the imposition of tariffs on Liberation Day and the U.S. government's decision to suspend exports of H20 GPUs to China. Such situations could recur and undermine NVIDIA's growth plans and market expansion efforts. Losing the Chinese market would have a significant impact on NVIDIA's business. Additionally, geopolitical events such as trade tariffs and sanctions could affect global supply or cloud computing spending in some of the key regions where NVIDIA operates. In conclusion, in this grand AI infrastructure game, NVIDIA is the queen. Currently, it is the most powerful and flexible piece on the board. Compared to peers that may occupy other key positions, NVIDIA controls every direction. For example, AMD is the rook, SMCI is the bishop, while Credo and Astera are agile knights. Ultimately, NVIDIA determines the pace and scope of this game. As AI demand continues to grow, NVIDIA's dominant position is further strengthened by the expansion of the Chinese market. || Follow-up: How do you define ""the dip""? I was curious after seeing so many stories of people who bought the April cash about how those people were funding the additional purchase and got a *ton* of great answers about how people balance/save/reallocate when things are going well and use that to fund when things are low

Which begs another question,(I might be stuck in a spiral here) - *how* do you define a dip? 

Obviously crashes like April 2nd - 7th are hard to miss but those seem to be pretty short windows over a multi-year horizon so I assume those of you who do a ""skim the top, buy the dip"" strategy have opportunities you're looking at more often?

A bit of background, I‚Äôd say I have a solid foundation: I'm a content creator with over 750,000 followers (the problem is validated in my content as well). I've previously published and sold apps, scaling them to 1.5 million downloads. I also have a strong team that's great at making products go viral, and I bring deep domain expertise in the niche and market we‚Äôre targeting.

The idea is an AI consumer app, and from what I‚Äôve seen, we‚Äôre first to market with this specific angle. Not to sound arrogant, but I believe the idea and the deck are pretty solid. I already have a Figma prototype, although it's not fully complete yet. So far, I've had a few meetings and received interest from some funds. A few have said they're open to investing at seed, or once I gain more traction or get the product to a more advanced stage.

Looking for VCs/investors that invest the earliest. Would love to see if anybody has any spreadsheets, lists, airtable, etc. of idea-stage, pre-mvp, pre-everything investors. || Does anyone have any VC/investor lists for idea-stage companies?

As Nvidia Corp. solidifies its position as a $4 trillion titan on the back of the AI hardware boom, a compelling debate is intensifying on Wall Street over what some see as a glaring valuation gap: Alphabet Inc., the parent company of Google.

While shares of the search giant have performed well, they have lagged the explosive, triple-digit gains of the companies building the ""picks and shovels"" of the AI revolution. This has led to a growing belief among some investors that Google, with its deeply integrated ""full stack"" of AI assets, is on the cusp of a significant re-rating. They are betting that the company‚Äôs upcoming second-quarter earnings report on July 23 will be the primary catalyst, forcing the market to shift its focus from the cost of Google's AI ambitions to the reality of its profits.

‚ÄúFor years, AI was a massive cost center for Google. The question for the second half of 2025 is whether it can become a massive profit center,‚Äù says one technology strategist. ‚ÄúNext week‚Äôs report is the first real test of that thesis.‚Äù

# The Unseen Competitor Winning the Streaming Wars

While investors have been fixated on Google's AI story, the recent earnings report from Netflix provided an inadvertent, and powerful, bull case for one of Google‚Äôs most valuable assets: YouTube.

Netflix‚Äôs management noted the intense competition for viewer engagement, and recent Nielsen data tells the story. In May, YouTube commanded 12.5% of all U.S. television screen time, significantly ahead of Netflix‚Äôs 7.5%. This data confirms that YouTube is not just a mobile video app, but the dominant media platform in the modern living room.

Financially, the scale is staggering. YouTube‚Äôs advertising revenue alone, at over $34 billion annually, is nearly the size of Netflix‚Äôs entire global enterprise. When combined with an estimated $19 billion in subscription revenue from YouTube Premium and YouTube TV, a hypothetical standalone ‚ÄúYouTube Inc.‚Äù would be a media behemoth with over $53 billion in annual sales, far outpacing its rivals.

‚ÄúNetflix‚Äôs earnings call was inadvertently the best bull case for YouTube we‚Äôve seen all year,‚Äù noted one portfolio manager. ‚ÄúIt confirmed who truly owns the living room, and that value has yet to be fully unlocked in Alphabet‚Äôs stock price.‚Äù

# The Bear Case Reimagined: Search as an AI Utility

A persistent fear among investors has been that AI chatbots would cannibalize Google‚Äôs core Search business, which remains its primary source of profit. A contrarian view is now emerging, however, that AI will not be a threat, but rather Search's greatest accelerator.

This thesis posits that as Large Language Models (LLMs) and AI agents become more prevalent, they will need constant access to the live, indexed web to provide up-to-date, reliable information. The most efficient and trusted source for that data is Google's Search index.

Under this model, the biggest new customers for Google Search may not be humans, but other AIs. This could transform the Search business from a consumer-facing advertising platform into a foundational ‚ÄúSearch as a Service‚Äù utility for the entire AI economy, monetized through high-margin, programmatic API access.

‚ÄúThe fear was that the search box would die,‚Äù says a tech strategist. ‚ÄúThe reality may be that the underlying Search index becomes the foundational data layer for the entire AI ecosystem‚Äîa far more valuable position.‚Äù

# The Path to $3 Trillion

For Google to close the valuation gap with its peers, investors believe the market must recognize the value of its interconnected empire. A ""sum-of-the-parts"" analysis reveals immense potential: a dominant media company in YouTube, a profitable and growing Cloud business, and a portfolio of high-risk, high-reward ""Other Bets"" like the autonomous driving unit, Waymo.

The ultimate validation of its AI leadership could come from a partnership with its biggest rival. Persistent rumors of Apple integrating Google's Gemini into iOS for advanced AI tasks draw a direct parallel to the estimated $20 billion annual deal Google pays Apple for its search default status. Such a deal would instantly cement Gemini's position as the indispensable intelligence layer for the mobile world.

The narrative for the past year has rightfully celebrated the companies building the infrastructure for AI. The bull case for Google is a bet that the focus is about to shift to the companies that can most effectively monetize it. Investors will be watching closely on July 23rd for the answer.

  
**TL;DR:**

* **Google is likely undervalued.** The market has rewarded AI hardware companies like Nvidia but hasn't yet priced in Google's ability to profit from its ""full-stack"" AI ecosystem. The July 23rd earnings report is the key catalyst to prove this.
* **YouTube is quietly winning the streaming wars.** It has more viewing time than Netflix, making it a dominant media empire whose massive value is not fully reflected in Google's stock price.
* **The ""AI is a threat to Search"" narrative is likely wrong.** The opposite is more probable: AI agents will become massive new customers, using the Google Search index as the essential data layer for the entire AI economy, creating a new, high-margin business.
* **For the first time, real revenue from AI subscriptions (Gemini, Veo) will be reported.** This shifts the story from ""AI is an expense"" to ""AI is a profit engine.""
* **A potential multi-billion dollar deal for Apple to use Gemini** (similar to their current Search deal) is a massive, often overlooked catalyst that would cement Google's AI supremacy.

A,2025-07-21,US,"How do we feel about Popmart (PMRTY)? There's been A LOT of mainstream hype around the IP at Popmart. Labubu is becoming a global phenomenon with, it seems like, people of all ages similar to a Hello Kitty or Miffy. They also have collaborations with Disney, Toei Animation, and other companies that have built-in audiences. There's an element of gambling with the blind boxes, a model that's popular in Asia and seems to be a growing trend here in the US. Their revenue growth has also been exploding. The only thing that gives me pause is the P/E ratio being 94 right now.

Wanted to get general thoughts on the stock and company? || SRPT's Shocking Stand: Company Rejects FDA Request To Pull Gene Therapy Elevidys >The ground shook for¬†Sarepta Therapeutics, Inc.¬†(NASDAQ:SRPT) last week as the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), alarmed by a third patient death tied to its gene therapy platform, pulled a rare move: requesting a voluntary halt to Elevidys shipments. The company‚Äôs response? A resounding ‚Äúno,‚Äù igniting a major regulatory clash with severe implications for patients and investors alike.

>The upheaval began on Friday when the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)¬†made a rare and impactful¬†announcement: it had placed Sarepta‚Äôs investigational gene therapy clinical trials for limb girdle muscular dystrophy (LGMD) on a clinical hold. This decision stemmed from serious safety concerns, including three patient deaths potentially linked to these products, indicating that study participants faced or would be exposed to an unreasonable and significant risk of illness or injury.

>In light of these developments, the FDA also formally¬†requested¬†Sarepta to voluntarily halt all shipments of Elevidys, the company‚Äôs approved gene therapy. However, in a move that set the stage for a major regulatory clash with severe implications for both patients and investors, Sarepta definitively refused this request.

>The three fatalities, which prompted the FDA‚Äôs strong action, have resulted from acute liver failure in individuals who had received either Elevidys or an investigational gene therapy utilizing the same AAVrh74 serotype, a viral vector used in gene delivery. Notably, one of these deaths occurred during a clinical trial for LGMD, conducted under an investigational new drug application.

>Adding to Sarepta‚Äôs challenges, the FDA further revoked the platform technology designation for the company‚Äôs AAVrh74 Platform Technology. This designation, typically granted to technologies with broad therapeutic promise that can streamline regulatory review, was rescinded because, given the new safety information, the preliminary evidence was deemed insufficient to demonstrate that the AAVrh74 Platform Technology could be incorporated into or utilized by multiple drugs¬†without adverse effects on safety.

>Elevidys had received traditional approval in June 2024 for ambulatory Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) patients aged four years and older with a confirmed DMD gene mutation. Previously, in June 2023, it secured accelerated, conditional approval for non-ambulatory DMD patients. However, continued approval for non-ambulatory patients is contingent upon verification of clinical benefit through confirmatory trials.

Selling RIOT, MSTX which were my bitcoin exposures.

Possibly keeping TMC (which I believe in the Deep Sea mining tech). But It's hard to keep something so volatile as a deep sea mine, mining is hard enough.

Will most likely keep:  
JEPQ (I see no reason not to just hold and DCA).

F (Such a good cost basis that I think I'll just keep it as is).

MO

PFE

HRZN (A risky but good historically dividend payer. It risks lower NAV due to IPO drought which will only get worse, but it has a great basket of companies it does private financing with).

TLTW  
TMF (which are my bond exposure, not principal secured).

I have direct bond ownership as well, so I moved over all of my:  
NVDA, MSFT into direct bond ownership at 170 and 500 prices respectively.

This market is just a clown show. People said ""earnings are better now than before"" but they actually aren't. The earnings are ""better"" because of a declining dollar. Which is fine, but that's not the same as ""PE is good"".

The market is grossly over valued going into an earnings recession at best. At worst we get a massive housing crisis that crushes earnings for 30% of the US economy, and a debt crisis that crushes earnings for MSFT, NVDA, META, GOOG, AMZN, etc.

The two halves of the economy that usually plays one off the other are both staring at their own disasters.

What I will buy later.

JEPQ after QQQ corrects (whatever that looks like).  
GLD if 20% drop in gold.  
Bitcoin at $80,000 to $90,000 this cycle.  
CCJ if a 30% or greater correction.  
TMC (if I sell) if it drops to 200day.  
KO if dividend yield reaches 3.3%  
CVX (oil exposure) if I can get a 7.5%+ dividend yield.  
MO at 7%+ Div yield but not stacking right now.

In rate cuts I'll be flipping my TMF/TLTW into mostly TBT and just sell covered calls on that to keep a good cost basis until the next rate hiking cycle. || Trying to diversify my portfolio. How did I do? 33M and I make 100k per year pretax.

Crispr gene editing biotech with strong balance sheet and several readouts in 2nd half of 2025 and 1st half of 2026. Recently a director bought $50mil of stock, the largest  purchase in many years. And not just any director, the managing partner of SR One, the spinout of GSK‚Äôs corporate venture arm. This guy knows what he is doing. A few weeks ago he posted on linkedin about 3 portfolio companies of SR One closing $1B in pharma partnerships. He knows what pharma looks for. CRSP probably will not be an acquisition target given its size (based on JPM HC last year), but partnerships and selling off assets with more proof of concept is a very real possibility in my opinion. Maybe even acquisition given its game changing pipeline with more data.

CRSP has one approved treatment (Casgevy) that is ex vivo (meaning cells from patients are removed, edited using crispr, then reintroduced) for sickle cell. Stock has lagged due to slow rollout and brutal regimen to prepare to treatment. Treatment can only happen in certain centres. CEO has described casgevy as akin to genetic ‚Äúsurgery‚Äù.

The bright side is that in 2025 and 2026, there is estimated to be many more casgevy patients and its administration to increase. Revenue is only recognized once the edited cells are administered back into the body of the patient which can take up to 2 months from removal.

The real game changers are the in vivo therapies they are working on. In vivo, meaning it will edit the cells inside the body. They just got positive phase 1 results for one of their CVD therapies. More to come with readouts.

Most battery tech journalism is frustrating because you will hear constant tales of a tech that will double or triple battery capacity, and then of course the change never happens. The reason for this is multi-faceted:

1) what works in a lab often doesn't work in real world conditions,
2) battery materials are like two faced super-models they can be absolutely perfect when looking at one metric, but can have debilitating shortcomings when looking at another, and

3) most of the time you need to see 100 different success stories in parallel to make a dramatic change happen, and the article speaks of the 1 improvement only and speaks as if the other 99 problems have already been solved.

If you're going to see a new type of battery that has the potential not to just dominate current markets, but to create entirely new markets for electrification; a convergence of multiple incredibly difficult to master technologies would need to happen in parallel. And there would need to be enabling tech that would allow each subcomponent to cover the flaws of the other so that in the aggregate you have a well-rounded battery that can dominate.

This type of battery is still a dream, anything more than a whisper and it can vanish. But for those of you who dare to dream with me, let me whisper away and explain what I might be seeing in the industry and how Enovix might play the crucial role in bringing it all together‚Ä¶

*Not financial advice, but if I were giving financial advice, I would advise you to assess ENVX based on the AI-1 battery and your assumptions as to market share, manufacturing, and margins that it can take in the  Consumer electronics space in the coming years.

So what type of potential battery am I talking about? A solid-state (sulfide based), sulfur cathode battery, with a pre-lithiated si anode. This type of battery would be sourced from cheap, scalable, and abundant materials with an energy density that could potentially enable regional flight or trans-pacific cargo shipping. But every step in that chain has immense hurdles to overcome before you can  get there. Let's evaluate the potential and the hurdles one by one, and let's see how it fits into the Enovix tech stack.

Let's start first with our baby, Enovix. I won't go deep into the details because my followers already know the story well. Enovix is not a Si battery company, it's a novel battery architecture, that has properties that enable it to use non-traditional battery materials. One such property is its ability to handle electrodes that swell. Electrodes that swell are the best kind, they swell because they are storing so much lithium they form a new alloy and balloon up in size. Intercalating (traditional) battery materials on the other hand can only store a little bit of lithium because they store the lithium between layers, like a bookshelf holding books.

So if you can build a battery mechanically designed to handle swelling, you've invented a new class of batteries. You've invented conversion class batteries.

But how does Enovix do this? Through a very simple trick in physics. Force=Pressure*Area. Enovix laser dices its electrodes and then stands them on their thin edge and stacks those thin edge standing electrodes for the width of their cell. What that has done is re-oriented the large face of the electrodes to the sides of the battery and not to the top of the battery. If using conversion style electrodes that swell, the larger part of the elctrodes are facing the small face of the battery (the side)  and not the large one. So again, F=P*A and what you've just done is dramatically reduced the A in the equation. That means you can dramatically reduce the F required in the equation to achieve a P that can constrain the urge to swell. Indeed, because of the orthogonal stacking, Enovix can easily add 10 Megapascals of stack pressure to the solid electrodes (the liquid electrolyte is under normal pressure) with a tiny constraint system. Typical prismatic cells have stack pressure around 0.1 Mpa maybe to up to 1 Mpa.

And then as a bonus, the shape of these electrodes stood on their thin edge provides easy access to pre-lithiate si anodes.

And then as an even better bonus the orientation just happens to be perfectly shaped like a heat exchanger. Having all of these strips of electrodes oriented this way allows uniform and very close access to cooling. We're talking 33x more efficient cooling. You can get the heat out of the center of the cell uniformly with ease.

There are other advantages, but for the rest of this discussion, Enovix's ability to provide stack pressure and its ability to provide extreme thermal control are going to be the two properties of the architecture that enable the rest of the magic I will soon discuss.


The next element of that super battery I need to discuss is the solid state element. ""Solid state is the holy grail of battery development"" is a common refrain. That's mostly marketing (inside joke for me), but solid state does have some extreme advantages.

Upsides:
1) Imagine picking up two bags of sand. One is wet and one is dry. Which one is lighter? A lot lighter

2) Because the electrolyte layer IS the separator, you get rid of the inactive separator. You also get rid of other inactive components that don't need to be there if there is no liquid electrolyte.

3) Often conflated with solid state tech is actually just anode side improvements. Solid state often works better with pure lithium metal on the anode side than can be done with liquid electrolytes; in a liquid electrolyte you have a more unstable SEI layer and in solid state you can have a stronger anode electrolyte      interface which can enable pure lithium metal anodes. That translates to serious gains for the whole system similar to what enovix sees by making massive anode side improvements using si. *I'm still skeptical on lithium metal working in the real world. It always will work in the lab, but lithium metal exists nowhere in nature as li metal because its too reactive.

4) No flammable electrolyte reduces fire hazard.

Downsides:
A battery is just a reversible chemistry reaction where negative electrons (electricity) flow in and out and positive ions (lithium in this case) flow back and forth between two electrodes. The flow of those positive ions is easier to facilitate in a liquid vs in a solid. But serious progress has been made using solids.

Ionic conductivity: this is the challenge of moving positive ions around. Surprisingly, sulfide based      electrolyte layers are getting so good that their Siemens per centimeter (how much resistance to moving ions) is approaching that and sometimes      exceeding liquid electrolytes. Quite frankly, this is miracle number 1 in the whole chain. The better the ionic conductivity, the thinner the electrolyte gets to be and just like regular separators thinner is better both for volume and for weight and for cost. Sulfide solid state has a clear advantage over oxide/ceramic based ones that have to be thicker both for ionic conductivity reasons and for brittleness reasons.

Interfacial Connection: think  of a relay race. The ionic conductivity is how fast the runners can run but the interface between the cathode->solid electrolyte->anode is like the baton exchange in a relay race. This is where SSB's tend to struggle. But it turns out, with sulfide based electrolyte layers high stack pressure can greatly improve the interfacial connection allowing for  a uniform and seamless connection between the layers of battery. (*hint, Enovix architecture easily provides stack pressure).

Hot spots and heat transfer issues. The liquid electrolyte doesn't just transfer the ions effectively,      it also transfer heat around the cell, bringing it to the edge of the cell where it can cooled. Without that liquid electrolyte, even though its less flammable, those hot spots will kill cycle life and cause degradation issues if not dealt with. *If only there were a perfect architecture for thermal control.

Dendrites in a lithium metal anode. Sulfide based SSB are considered more prone to dendrites than oxide      based SSB's. This is likely why NIO, makes their semi-solid state battery based on a sulfide layer with a prelithiated Si-C mix on the anode side rather than the lithium metal side. (I wonder who else can do that anode side trick‚Ä¶.but at a much higher % of Si-C?)

Moisture sensitivity: sulfides are extremely sensitive to moisture and current manufacturers like Toyota have worked to use additives and coatings that make it less      so.

Manufacturability: Can you make the electrolyte? Once you've made that, can you then use it when      manufacturing the cell itself? Sulfide based electrolytes are extremely sensitive to moisture and oxygen, and using them to make a cell would likely require at least some of the steps to be done in a pure argon or a pure nitrogen environment, which means lights off automation would be required for those steps.

I don't want to understate the challenge here. Being able to allow ion transfer in a solid electrolyte is incredibly challenging to make happen in a cell, and incredibly difficult to manufacture in a scalable process. But there are at least two companies (Nio and Cherry) already taking this trick to production ready cells in China, and companies like Toyota/Samsung/Solid Power all have made incredible progress. Sulfide based SSB's are clearly stepping out of the proof of concept stage and starting to be ready for the next level. If you add in an architecture that easily adds stack pressure and thermal control, you might be on to something‚Ä¶

$ENVX

We've now made it to the cathode side of this super battery equation. Sulfur based cathodes. Unlike every single other battery cathode on the marketplace today that is intercalating, sulfur is a conversion style cathode. That means it forms an alloy with the lithium and can store much Much MUCH more lithium than anything else on the market. It's also incredibly abundant, cheap, and light.

So why the hell are you just hearing about it now? Did an anon on Twitter discover this wonder battery material under everyone's nose? Of course not. Sulfur is the definition of the two-faced supermodel. It's amazing in some respects, and atrocious in other respects. If you can find a way to cover its weaknesses, you have a potential super battery.

What are those weaknesses? First and foremost you have serious cycle life issues resulting from ""polysulfide shuttling."" Lithium sulfur undergoes multiple reactions when it takes in and then releases lithium and in this process tiny ""polysulfides"" can escape to the anode side and this absolutely wrecks any hope of cycle life you had with the battery. Current lithium sulfur cathode makers are trying to mitigate this by using various carbon products to trap the polysulfides before they shuttle away.

But it turns out there is a much more effective way to contain the number 1 problem of polysulfide shuttling. The solution is to pair sulfur based cathodes with sulfide based solid state electrolytes. This 100% filters out any polysulfides shutting all the way to the anode. 100%. Now there likely still is some impact from cathode side only polysulfide shuttling, but we're talking 95% of the problem is solved for you if you can pair sulfur cathode with sulfide electrolyte.

So once again, did I, an anon on twitter just discover this amazing trick that has eluded battery chemists for decades? Of course not. As a conversion style cathode, Sulfur expands and contracts by up to 80% of its volume in charge and discharge. This means that the number one unsolved problem for SSB's, that of interfacial contact between the layers, becomes virtually impossible to do with sulfur based cathodes making the point moot. 

But what if you have a battery architecture that can easily add in extremely high stack pressure in such a way that the expansion is controlled. The interface between the particles even in a sulfur cathode are perfectly uniform and perfectly in contact with a sulfide based electrolyte? That's exactly what Enovix can do. 

But sulfur's amazing potential isn't purely held back by polysulfide shuttling. It also is known for very low power output. We're talking 0.1 C power output (weak sauce), when the batteries required for drones are going to need to be on the order of 10C. This is where the work of the cathode manufacturers pairing it with new types of easily made carbon are making massive amounts of progress. Multiple companies and universities are now testing lithium sulfur based cathodes that are both high capacity and high power now, unheard of only a few years ago.

The next downside to sulfur unfortunately is volumetric density. Gravimetrically it is untouchable. Volumetrically it is weak. Cathode makers have to use low sulfur loading to increase its power output and also a lot of binder to glue it together during its expansion and contraction. In addition, they try to space it out pretty far apart to allow for said expansion and contraction. Once again, the Enovix high stack pressure can make a dramatic difference here. It can greatly reduce the amount of binder required, and the mechanical system is designed for the stuff to be packed in tight, because it is a conversion class battery designed to handle the swell.

The final problem I will discuss is one of heat. All Enovix investors know, the secret to extreme fast charge is rapid and uniform heat extraction from the center of the cell during charging. Fast charge brings in a ton of resistive heating related to bringing all that power in at once. But lesser known, is the fact that most intercalating cathode materials have a slightly endothermic reaction when the cathode gives up the lithium during charging. This means the chemical reaction that occurs during charging of say an LCO cathode, actually reduces the heat in the cell not adds to it. But sulfur is different. When it gives up the lithium, that multi stage reaction is exothermic at every stage. Meaning, if you want to fast charge you now have to get the resistive heat (resistive heat is why a toaster gets hot) out as well as the heat from the chemical reaction itself. And to add pain to this equation, if you're doing all of this in a solid state battery, you don't have a liquid that can rapidly transfer the heat from the center of the cell to the edge. If you don't have a battery form factor/architecture specifically designed for rapid heat extraction, you are going to create hotspots that kill the cycle life of your battery.

Hopefully now you are starting to see why having a battery that can provide high stack pressure and extreme thermal control is not just a nice to have, but is absolutely crucial to making this type of battery work.

$ENVX

We're now to the anode side. I won't belabor this point because everyone knows this is already where Enovix shines. It takes 100% Si-C, prelithiates it, and then uses that anode side advantage in conjunction with regular LCO on the cathode to create the AI-1 battery that is about to take the high margin consumer electronics space by storm.

I will reiterate, that the knock on sulfide based solid state electrolyte is that it is more prone to dendrite formation when compared with oxide based SSB. So while sulfides are basically twice as ionically conductive allowing it to be much thinner (both lighter and more volumetrically dense), it may not be as reliable when using lithium metal. Well, the very easy solution to this is to use si on the anode side, especially if you're partnering with a si anode expert.

BTW, NIO currently makes semi-solid state batteries (using traditional cathode materials and retaining half the liquid weight because its only semi solid state), and they use si on the anode side presumably for this exact reason. In real world conditions, the only route to get to extremely high cycle life for this type of battery is si on the anode side not li metal imho.

$ENVX

Let me summarize. There is a whisper of a dream for a potential battery that would not just be an upgrade to existing batteries, it would be a world changing technology that future historians would list alongside the invention of the steam engine. But in order to achieve this multiple miracles from an entire ecosystem of companies and universities would have to happen in parallel and the subcomponents all have to work in concert to hide each other's weaknesses.

But, in theory.....

1) The main weakness of the  sulfur based cathode (polysulfide shuttling) can be solved by using a      sulfide based SSB

2) The main weakness of a SSB, especially when paired with an expanding and contracting sulfur based      cathode (interfacial connectivity), can be solved by high stack pressure easily achieved using Enovix architecture.

3) The second main weakness for sulfur based cathodes of volumetric density, can be dramatically improved by the high stack pressure easily achieved using Enovix Architecture.

4) The serious problem of dendrite formation from a sulfide based SSB can be solved using pre lithiated si on the anode side rather than li metal, a technique Enovix has already perfected.

5) The serious problems regarding heat extraction and thermal control that would come from a sulfur based cathode having exothermic reactions during charging, and made  worse by an all solid battery without the liquid electrolyte to transfer heat around, would have to be solved by a battery architecture that      specifically enables rapid and uniform heat extraction.

All of this would have to be manufactured by teams of experts capable of manufacturing in extreme      environments. Microchip manufacturers do that every day.

Other problems like power output for sulfur based cathodes or ionic conductivity for sulfide based solid electrolytes are immensely challenging, but appear to be being solved by multiple companies as we speak. Enovix potentially can serve as the architecture and partner that enables it all. 

Now the beauty of this whole thing is, it's not a zero to 1 proposition for Enovix. As we speak, Enovix is about to capitalize on being able to produce batteries with JUST the anode side of this equation. The AI-1 battery that is north of 900 Wh/L, has a 3C charge rate, high cycle life, and AI enabling power output is the result of only one side of this equation paired with an LCO cathode. And after that, if they're challenged they'll implement a higher voltage cathode (likely specially coated LCO) to continue their dominance. But in the background, they can be working on bringing together the next gen battery ecosystem required to make this much bigger dream happen. Maybe the next step is just the SSB side. And then the final step would be the sulfur cathode paired with it all. This is all wildly speculative, but extremely exciting. It should at least be known that these potential tech tree combinations appear to be coming together.

BTW, NIO currently makes semi-solid state batteries (using traditional cathode materials and retaining half the liquid weight because its only semi solid state), and they use si on the anode side presumably for this exact reason. In real world conditions, the only route to get to extremely high cycle life for this type of battery is si on the anode side not li metal imho.

$ENVX

Let me summarize. There is a whisper of a dream for a potential battery that would not just be an upgrade to existing batteries, it would be a world changing technology that future historians would list alongside the invention of the steam engine. But in order to achieve this multiple miracles from an entire ecosystem of companies and universities would have to happen in parallel and the subcomponents all have to work in concert to hide each other's weaknesses.

But, in theory.....

1) The main weakness of the  sulfur based cathode (polysulfide shuttling) can be solved by using a      sulfide based SSB

2) The main weakness of a SSB, especially when paired with an expanding and contracting sulfur based      cathode (interfacial connectivity), can be solved by high stack pressure easily achieved using Enovix architecture.

3) The second main weakness for sulfur based cathodes of volumetric density, can be dramatically improved by the high stack pressure easily achieved using Enovix Architecture.

4) The serious problem of dendrite formation from a sulfide based SSB can be solved using pre lithiated si on the anode side rather than li metal, a technique Enovix has already perfected.

5) The serious problems regarding heat extraction and thermal control that would come from a sulfur based cathode having exothermic reactions during charging, and made  worse by an all solid battery without the liquid electrolyte to transfer heat around, would have to be solved by a battery architecture that      specifically enables rapid and uniform heat extraction.

All of this would have to be manufactured by teams of experts capable of manufacturing in extreme      environments. Microchip manufacturers do that every day.

Other problems like power output for sulfur based cathodes or ionic conductivity for sulfide based solid electrolytes are immensely challenging, but appear to be being solved by multiple companies as we speak. Enovix potentially can serve as the architecture and partner that enables it all. 

Now the beauty of this whole thing is, it's not a zero to 1 proposition for Enovix. As we speak, Enovix is about to capitalize on being able to produce batteries with JUST the anode side of this equation. The AI-1 battery that is north of 900 Wh/L, has a 3C charge rate, high cycle life, and AI enabling power output is the result of only one side of this equation paired with an LCO cathode. And after that, if they're challenged they'll implement a higher voltage cathode (likely specially coated LCO) to continue their dominance. But in the background, they can be working on bringing together the next gen battery ecosystem required to make this much bigger dream happen. Maybe the next step is just the SSB side. And then the final step would be the sulfur cathode paired with it all. This is all wildly speculative, but extremely exciting. It should at least be known that these potential tech tree combinations appear to be coming together.

Most battery tech journalism is frustrating because you will hear constant tales of a tech that will double or triple battery capacity, and then of course the change never happens. The reason for this is multi-faceted:

1) what works in a lab often doesn't work in real world conditions,
2) battery materials are like two faced super-models they can be absolutely perfect when looking at one metric, but can have debilitating shortcomings when looking at another, and

3) most of the time you need to see 100 different success stories in parallel to make a dramatic change happen, and the article speaks of the 1 improvement only and speaks as if the other 99 problems have already been solved.

If you're going to see a new type of battery that has the potential not to just dominate current markets, but to create entirely new markets for electrification; a convergence of multiple incredibly difficult to master technologies would need to happen in parallel. And there would need to be enabling tech that would allow each subcomponent to cover the flaws of the other so that in the aggregate you have a well-rounded battery that can dominate.

This type of battery is still a dream, anything more than a whisper and it can vanish. But for those of you who dare to dream with me, let me whisper away and explain what I might be seeing in the industry and how Enovix might play the crucial role in bringing it all together‚Ä¶

*Not financial advice, but if I were giving financial advice, I would advise you to assess ENVX based on the AI-1 battery and your assumptions as to market share, manufacturing, and margins that it can take in the  Consumer electronics space in the coming years.

So what type of potential battery am I talking about? A solid-state (sulfide based), sulfur cathode battery, with a pre-lithiated si anode. This type of battery would be sourced from cheap, scalable, and abundant materials with an energy density that could potentially enable regional flight or trans-pacific cargo shipping. But every step in that chain has immense hurdles to overcome before you can  get there. Let's evaluate the potential and the hurdles one by one, and let's see how it fits into the Enovix tech stack.

Let's start first with our baby, Enovix. I won't go deep into the details because my followers already know the story well. Enovix is not a Si battery company, it's a novel battery architecture, that has properties that enable it to use non-traditional battery materials. One such property is its ability to handle electrodes that swell. Electrodes that swell are the best kind, they swell because they are storing so much lithium they form a new alloy and balloon up in size. Intercalating (traditional) battery materials on the other hand can only store a little bit of lithium because they store the lithium between layers, like a bookshelf holding books.

So if you can build a battery mechanically designed to handle swelling, you've invented a new class of batteries. You've invented conversion class batteries.

But how does Enovix do this? Through a very simple trick in physics. Force=Pressure*Area. Enovix laser dices its electrodes and then stands them on their thin edge and stacks those thin edge standing electrodes for the width of their cell. What that has done is re-oriented the large face of the electrodes to the sides of the battery and not to the top of the battery. If using conversion style electrodes that swell, the larger part of the elctrodes are facing the small face of the battery (the side)  and not the large one. So again, F=P*A and what you've just done is dramatically reduced the A in the equation. That means you can dramatically reduce the F required in the equation to achieve a P that can constrain the urge to swell. Indeed, because of the orthogonal stacking, Enovix can easily add 10 Megapascals of stack pressure to the solid electrodes (the liquid electrolyte is under normal pressure) with a tiny constraint system. Typical prismatic cells have stack pressure around 0.1 Mpa maybe to up to 1 Mpa.

And then as a bonus, the shape of these electrodes stood on their thin edge provides easy access to pre-lithiate si anodes.

And then as an even better bonus the orientation just happens to be perfectly shaped like a heat exchanger. Having all of these strips of electrodes oriented this way allows uniform and very close access to cooling. We're talking 33x more efficient cooling. You can get the heat out of the center of the cell uniformly with ease.

There are other advantages, but for the rest of this discussion, Enovix's ability to provide stack pressure and its ability to provide extreme thermal control are going to be the two properties of the architecture that enable the rest of the magic I will soon discuss.


The next element of that super battery I need to discuss is the solid state element. ""Solid state is the holy grail of battery development"" is a common refrain. That's mostly marketing (inside joke for me), but solid state does have some extreme advantages.

Upsides:
1) Imagine picking up two bags of sand. One is wet and one is dry. Which one is lighter? A lot lighter

2) Because the electrolyte layer IS the separator, you get rid of the inactive separator. You also get rid of other inactive components that don't need to be there if there is no liquid electrolyte.

3) Often conflated with solid state tech is actually just anode side improvements. Solid state often works better with pure lithium metal on the anode side than can be done with liquid electrolytes; in a liquid electrolyte you have a more unstable SEI layer and in solid state you can have a stronger anode electrolyte      interface which can enable pure lithium metal anodes. That translates to serious gains for the whole system similar to what enovix sees by making massive anode side improvements using si. *I'm still skeptical on lithium metal working in the real world. It always will work in the lab, but lithium metal exists nowhere in nature as li metal because its too reactive.

4) No flammable electrolyte reduces fire hazard.

Downsides:
A battery is just a reversible chemistry reaction where negative electrons (electricity) flow in and out and positive ions (lithium in this case) flow back and forth between two electrodes. The flow of those positive ions is easier to facilitate in a liquid vs in a solid. But serious progress has been made using solids.

Ionic conductivity: this is the challenge of moving positive ions around. Surprisingly, sulfide based      electrolyte layers are getting so good that their Siemens per centimeter (how much resistance to moving ions) is approaching that and sometimes      exceeding liquid electrolytes. Quite frankly, this is miracle number 1 in the whole chain. The better the ionic conductivity, the thinner the electrolyte gets to be and just like regular separators thinner is better both for volume and for weight and for cost. Sulfide solid state has a clear advantage over oxide/ceramic based ones that have to be thicker both for ionic conductivity reasons and for brittleness reasons.

Interfacial Connection: think  of a relay race. The ionic conductivity is how fast the runners can run but the interface between the cathode->solid electrolyte->anode is like the baton exchange in a relay race. This is where SSB's tend to struggle. But it turns out, with sulfide based electrolyte layers high stack pressure can greatly improve the interfacial connection allowing for  a uniform and seamless connection between the layers of battery. (*hint, Enovix architecture easily provides stack pressure).

Hot spots and heat transfer issues. The liquid electrolyte doesn't just transfer the ions effectively,      it also transfer heat around the cell, bringing it to the edge of the cell where it can cooled. Without that liquid electrolyte, even though its less flammable, those hot spots will kill cycle life and cause degradation issues if not dealt with. *If only there were a perfect architecture for thermal control.

Dendrites in a lithium metal anode. Sulfide based SSB are considered more prone to dendrites than oxide      based SSB's. This is likely why NIO, makes their semi-solid state battery based on a sulfide layer with a prelithiated Si-C mix on the anode side rather than the lithium metal side. (I wonder who else can do that anode side trick‚Ä¶.but at a much higher % of Si-C?)

Moisture sensitivity: sulfides are extremely sensitive to moisture and current manufacturers like Toyota have worked to use additives and coatings that make it less      so.

Manufacturability: Can you make the electrolyte? Once you've made that, can you then use it when      manufacturing the cell itself? Sulfide based electrolytes are extremely sensitive to moisture and oxygen, and using them to make a cell would likely require at least some of the steps to be done in a pure argon or a pure nitrogen environment, which means lights off automation would be required for those steps.

I don't want to understate the challenge here. Being able to allow ion transfer in a solid electrolyte is incredibly challenging to make happen in a cell, and incredibly difficult to manufacture in a scalable process. But there are at least two companies (Nio and Cherry) already taking this trick to production ready cells in China, and companies like Toyota/Samsung/Solid Power all have made incredible progress. Sulfide based SSB's are clearly stepping out of the proof of concept stage and starting to be ready for the next level. If you add in an architecture that easily adds stack pressure and thermal control, you might be on to something‚Ä¶

$ENVX

We've now made it to the cathode side of this super battery equation. Sulfur based cathodes. Unlike every single other battery cathode on the marketplace today that is intercalating, sulfur is a conversion style cathode. That means it forms an alloy with the lithium and can store much Much MUCH more lithium than anything else on the market. It's also incredibly abundant, cheap, and light.

So why the hell are you just hearing about it now? Did an anon on Twitter discover this wonder battery material under everyone's nose? Of course not. Sulfur is the definition of the two-faced supermodel. It's amazing in some respects, and atrocious in other respects. If you can find a way to cover its weaknesses, you have a potential super battery.

What are those weaknesses? First and foremost you have serious cycle life issues resulting from ""polysulfide shuttling."" Lithium sulfur undergoes multiple reactions when it takes in and then releases lithium and in this process tiny ""polysulfides"" can escape to the anode side and this absolutely wrecks any hope of cycle life you had with the battery. Current lithium sulfur cathode makers are trying to mitigate this by using various carbon products to trap the polysulfides before they shuttle away.

But it turns out there is a much more effective way to contain the number 1 problem of polysulfide shuttling. The solution is to pair sulfur based cathodes with sulfide based solid state electrolytes. This 100% filters out any polysulfides shutting all the way to the anode. 100%. Now there likely still is some impact from cathode side only polysulfide shuttling, but we're talking 95% of the problem is solved for you if you can pair sulfur cathode with sulfide electrolyte.

So once again, did I, an anon on twitter just discover this amazing trick that has eluded battery chemists for decades? Of course not. As a conversion style cathode, Sulfur expands and contracts by up to 80% of its volume in charge and discharge. This means that the number one unsolved problem for SSB's, that of interfacial contact between the layers, becomes virtually impossible to do with sulfur based cathodes making the point moot. 

But what if you have a battery architecture that can easily add in extremely high stack pressure in such a way that the expansion is controlled. The interface between the particles even in a sulfur cathode are perfectly uniform and perfectly in contact with a sulfide based electrolyte? That's exactly what Enovix can do. 

But sulfur's amazing potential isn't purely held back by polysulfide shuttling. It also is known for very low power output. We're talking 0.1 C power output (weak sauce), when the batteries required for drones are going to need to be on the order of 10C. This is where the work of the cathode manufacturers pairing it with new types of easily made carbon are making massive amounts of progress. Multiple companies and universities are now testing lithium sulfur based cathodes that are both high capacity and high power now, unheard of only a few years ago.

The next downside to sulfur unfortunately is volumetric density. Gravimetrically it is untouchable. Volumetrically it is weak. Cathode makers have to use low sulfur loading to increase its power output and also a lot of binder to glue it together during its expansion and contraction. In addition, they try to space it out pretty far apart to allow for said expansion and contraction. Once again, the Enovix high stack pressure can make a dramatic difference here. It can greatly reduce the amount of binder required, and the mechanical system is designed for the stuff to be packed in tight, because it is a conversion class battery designed to handle the swell.

The final problem I will discuss is one of heat. All Enovix investors know, the secret to extreme fast charge is rapid and uniform heat extraction from the center of the cell during charging. Fast charge brings in a ton of resistive heating related to bringing all that power in at once. But lesser known, is the fact that most intercalating cathode materials have a slightly endothermic reaction when the cathode gives up the lithium during charging. This means the chemical reaction that occurs during charging of say an LCO cathode, actually reduces the heat in the cell not adds to it. But sulfur is different. When it gives up the lithium, that multi stage reaction is exothermic at every stage. Meaning, if you want to fast charge you now have to get the resistive heat (resistive heat is why a toaster gets hot) out as well as the heat from the chemical reaction itself. And to add pain to this equation, if you're doing all of this in a solid state battery, you don't have a liquid that can rapidly transfer the heat from the center of the cell to the edge. If you don't have a battery form factor/architecture specifically designed for rapid heat extraction, you are going to create hotspots that kill the cycle life of your battery.

Hopefully now you are starting to see why having a battery that can provide high stack pressure and extreme thermal control is not just a nice to have, but is absolutely crucial to making this type of battery work.

$ENVX

We're now to the anode side. I won't belabor this point because everyone knows this is already where Enovix shines. It takes 100% Si-C, prelithiates it, and then uses that anode side advantage in conjunction with regular LCO on the cathode to create the AI-1 battery that is about to take the high margin consumer electronics space by storm.

I will reiterate, that the knock on sulfide based solid state electrolyte is that it is more prone to dendrite formation when compared with oxide based SSB. So while sulfides are basically twice as ionically conductive allowing it to be much thinner (both lighter and more volumetrically dense), it may not be as reliable when using lithium metal. Well, the very easy solution to this is to use si on the anode side, especially if you're partnering with a si anode expert.

Meaning, if you want to fast charge you now have to get the resistive heat (resistive heat is why a toaster gets hot) out as well as the heat from the chemical reaction itself. And to add pain to this equation, if you're doing all of this in a solid state battery, you don't have a liquid that can rapidly transfer the heat from the center of the cell to the edge. If you don't have a battery form factor/architecture specifically designed for rapid heat extraction, you are going to create hotspots that kill the cycle life of your battery.

Hopefully now you are starting to see why having a battery that can provide high stack pressure and extreme thermal control is not just a nice to have, but is absolutely crucial to making this type of battery work.

$ENVX

We're now to the anode side. I won't belabor this point because everyone knows this is already where Enovix shines. It takes 100% Si-C, prelithiates it, and then uses that anode side advantage in conjunction with regular LCO on the cathode to create the AI-1 battery that is about to take the high margin consumer electronics space by storm.

I will reiterate, that the knock on sulfide based solid state electrolyte is that it is more prone to dendrite formation when compared with oxide based SSB. So while sulfides are basically twice as ionically conductive allowing it to be much thinner (both lighter and more volumetrically dense), it may not be as reliable when using lithium metal. Well, the very easy solution to this is to use si on the anode side, especially if you're partnering with a si anode expert.

BTW, NIO currently makes semi-solid state batteries (using traditional cathode materials and retaining half the liquid weight because its only semi solid state), and they use si on the anode side presumably for this exact reason. In real world conditions, the only route to get to extremely high cycle life for this type of battery is si on the anode side not li metal imho.

$ENVX

Let me summarize. There is a whisper of a dream for a potential battery that would not just be an upgrade to existing batteries, it would be a world changing technology that future historians would list alongside the invention of the steam engine. But in order to achieve this multiple miracles from an entire ecosystem of companies and universities would have to happen in parallel and the subcomponents all have to work in concert to hide each other's weaknesses.

But, in theory.....

1) The main weakness of the  sulfur based cathode (polysulfide shuttling) can be solved by using a      sulfide based SSB

2) The main weakness of a SSB, especially when paired with an expanding and contracting sulfur based      cathode (interfacial connectivity), can be solved by high stack pressure easily achieved using Enovix architecture.

3) The second main weakness for sulfur based cathodes of volumetric density, can be dramatically improved by the high stack pressure easily achieved using Enovix Architecture.

4) The serious problem of dendrite formation from a sulfide based SSB can be solved using pre lithiated si on the anode side rather than li metal, a technique Enovix has already perfected.

5) The serious problems regarding heat extraction and thermal control that would come from a sulfur based cathode having exothermic reactions during charging, and made  worse by an all solid battery without the liquid electrolyte to transfer heat around, would have to be solved by a battery architecture that      specifically enables rapid and uniform heat extraction.

All of this would have to be manufactured by teams of experts capable of manufacturing in extreme      environments. Microchip manufacturers do that every day.

Other problems like power output for sulfur based cathodes or ionic conductivity for sulfide based solid electrolytes are immensely challenging, but appear to be being solved by multiple companies as we speak. Enovix potentially can serve as the architecture and partner that enables it all. 

Now the beauty of this whole thing is, it's not a zero to 1 proposition for Enovix. As we speak, Enovix is about to capitalize on being able to produce batteries with JUST the anode side of this equation. The AI-1 battery that is north of 900 Wh/L, has a 3C charge rate, high cycle life, and AI enabling power output is the result of only one side of this equation paired with an LCO cathode. And after that, if they're challenged they'll implement a higher voltage cathode (likely specially coated LCO) to continue their dominance. But in the background, they can be working on bringing together the next gen battery ecosystem required to make this much bigger dream happen. Maybe the next step is just the SSB side. And then the final step would be the sulfur cathode paired with it all. This is all wildly speculative, but extremely exciting. It should at least be known that these potential tech tree combinations appear to be coming together.

Most battery tech journalism is frustrating because you will hear constant tales of a tech that will double or triple battery capacity, and then of course the change never happens. The reason for this is multi-faceted:

1) what works in a lab often doesn't work in real world conditions,
2) battery materials are like two faced super-models they can be absolutely perfect when looking at one metric, but can have debilitating shortcomings when looking at another, and

3) most of the time you need to see 100 different success stories in parallel to make a dramatic change happen, and the article speaks of the 1 improvement only and speaks as if the other 99 problems have already been solved.

If you're going to see a new type of battery that has the potential not to just dominate current markets, but to create entirely new markets for electrification; a convergence of multiple incredibly difficult to master technologies would need to happen in parallel. And there would need to be enabling tech that would allow each subcomponent to cover the flaws of the other so that in the aggregate you have a well-rounded battery that can dominate.

This type of battery is still a dream, anything more than a whisper and it can vanish. But for those of you who dare to dream with me, let me whisper away and explain what I might be seeing in the industry and how Enovix might play the crucial role in bringing it all together‚Ä¶

*Not financial advice, but if I were giving financial advice, I would advise you to assess ENVX based on the AI-1 battery and your assumptions as to market share, manufacturing, and margins that it can take in the  Consumer electronics space in the coming years.

So what type of potential battery am I talking about? A solid-state (sulfide based), sulfur cathode battery, with a pre-lithiated si anode. This type of battery would be sourced from cheap, scalable, and abundant materials with an energy density that could potentially enable regional flight or trans-pacific cargo shipping. But every step in that chain has immense hurdles to overcome before you can  get there. Let's evaluate the potential and the hurdles one by one, and let's see how it fits into the Enovix tech stack.

Let's start first with our baby, Enovix. I won't go deep into the details because my followers already know the story well. Enovix is not a Si battery company, it's a novel battery architecture, that has properties that enable it to use non-traditional battery materials. One such property is its ability to handle electrodes that swell. Electrodes that swell are the best kind, they swell because they are storing so much lithium they form a new alloy and balloon up in size. Intercalating (traditional) battery materials on the other hand can only store a little bit of lithium because they store the lithium between layers, like a bookshelf holding books.

So if you can build a battery mechanically designed to handle swelling, you've invented a new class of batteries. You've invented conversion class batteries.

But how does Enovix do this? Through a very simple trick in physics. Force=Pressure*Area. Enovix laser dices its electrodes and then stands them on their thin edge and stacks those thin edge standing electrodes for the width of their cell. What that has done is re-oriented the large face of the electrodes to the sides of the battery and not to the top of the battery. If using conversion style electrodes that swell, the larger part of the elctrodes are facing the small face of the battery (the side)  and not the large one. So again, F=P*A and what you've just done is dramatically reduced the A in the equation. That means you can dramatically reduce the F required in the equation to achieve a P that can constrain the urge to swell. Indeed, because of the orthogonal stacking, Enovix can easily add 10 Megapascals of stack pressure to the solid electrodes (the liquid electrolyte is under normal pressure) with a tiny constraint system. Typical prismatic cells have stack pressure around 0.1 Mpa maybe to up to 1 Mpa.

And then as a bonus, the shape of these electrodes stood on their thin edge provides easy access to pre-lithiate si anodes.

And then as an even better bonus the orientation just happens to be perfectly shaped like a heat exchanger. Having all of these strips of electrodes oriented this way allows uniform and very close access to cooling. We're talking 33x more efficient cooling. You can get the heat out of the center of the cell uniformly with ease.

There are other advantages, but for the rest of this discussion, Enovix's ability to provide stack pressure and its ability to provide extreme thermal control are going to be the two properties of the architecture that enable the rest of the magic I will soon discuss.


The next element of that super battery I need to discuss is the solid state element. ""Solid state is the holy grail of battery development"" is a common refrain. That's mostly marketing (inside joke for me), but solid state does have some extreme advantages.

Upsides:
1) Imagine picking up two bags of sand. One is wet and one is dry. Which one is lighter? A lot lighter

2) Because the electrolyte layer IS the separator, you get rid of the inactive separator. You also get rid of other inactive components that don't need to be there if there is no liquid electrolyte.

3) Often conflated with solid state tech is actually just anode side improvements. Solid state often works better with pure lithium metal on the anode side than can be done with liquid electrolytes; in a liquid electrolyte you have a more unstable SEI layer and in solid state you can have a stronger anode electrolyte      interface which can enable pure lithium metal anodes. That translates to serious gains for the whole system similar to what enovix sees by making massive anode side improvements using si. *I'm still skeptical on lithium metal working in the real world. It always will work in the lab, but lithium metal exists nowhere in nature as li metal because its too reactive.

4) No flammable electrolyte reduces fire hazard.

Downsides:
A battery is just a reversible chemistry reaction where negative electrons (electricity) flow in and out and positive ions (lithium in this case) flow back and forth between two electrodes. The flow of those positive ions is easier to facilitate in a liquid vs in a solid. But serious progress has been made using solids.

Ionic conductivity: this is the challenge of moving positive ions around. Surprisingly, sulfide based      electrolyte layers are getting so good that their Siemens per centimeter (how much resistance to moving ions) is approaching that and sometimes      exceeding liquid electrolytes. Quite frankly, this is miracle number 1 in the whole chain. The better the ionic conductivity, the thinner the electrolyte gets to be and just like regular separators thinner is better both for volume and for weight and for cost. Sulfide solid state has a clear advantage over oxide/ceramic based ones that have to be thicker both for ionic conductivity reasons and for brittleness reasons.

Interfacial Connection: think  of a relay race. The ionic conductivity is how fast the runners can run but the interface between the cathode->solid electrolyte->anode is like the baton exchange in a relay race. This is where SSB's tend to struggle. But it turns out, with sulfide based electrolyte layers high stack pressure can greatly improve the interfacial connection allowing for  a uniform and seamless connection between the layers of battery. (*hint, Enovix architecture easily provides stack pressure).

Hot spots and heat transfer issues. The liquid electrolyte doesn't just transfer the ions effectively,      it also transfer heat around the cell, bringing it to the edge of the cell where it can cooled. Without that liquid electrolyte, even though its less flammable, those hot spots will kill cycle life and cause degradation issues if not dealt with. *If only there were a perfect architecture for thermal control.

Dendrites in a lithium metal anode. Sulfide based SSB are considered more prone to dendrites than oxide      based SSB's. This is likely why NIO, makes their semi-solid state battery based on a sulfide layer with a prelithiated Si-C mix on the anode side rather than the lithium metal side. (I wonder who else can do that anode side trick‚Ä¶.but at a much higher % of Si-C?)

Moisture sensitivity: sulfides are extremely sensitive to moisture and current manufacturers like Toyota have worked to use additives and coatings that make it less      so.

Manufacturability: Can you make the electrolyte? Once you've made that, can you then use it when      manufacturing the cell itself? Sulfide based electrolytes are extremely sensitive to moisture and oxygen, and using them to make a cell would likely require at least some of the steps to be done in a pure argon or a pure nitrogen environment, which means lights off automation would be required for those steps.

I don't want to understate the challenge here. Being able to allow ion transfer in a solid electrolyte is incredibly challenging to make happen in a cell, and incredibly difficult to manufacture in a scalable process. But there are at least two companies (Nio and Cherry) already taking this trick to production ready cells in China, and companies like Toyota/Samsung/Solid Power all have made incredible progress. Sulfide based SSB's are clearly stepping out of the proof of concept stage and starting to be ready for the next level. If you add in an architecture that easily adds stack pressure and thermal control, you might be on to something‚Ä¶

$ENVX

We've now made it to the cathode side of this super battery equation. Sulfur based cathodes. Unlike every single other battery cathode on the marketplace today that is intercalating, sulfur is a conversion style cathode. That means it forms an alloy with the lithium and can store much Much MUCH more lithium than anything else on the market. It's also incredibly abundant, cheap, and light.

So why the hell are you just hearing about it now? Did an anon on Twitter discover this wonder battery material under everyone's nose? Of course not. Sulfur is the definition of the two-faced supermodel. It's amazing in some respects, and atrocious in other respects. If you can find a way to cover its weaknesses, you have a potential super battery.

What are those weaknesses? First and foremost you have serious cycle life issues resulting from ""polysulfide shuttling."" Lithium sulfur undergoes multiple reactions when it takes in and then releases lithium and in this process tiny ""polysulfides"" can escape to the anode side and this absolutely wrecks any hope of cycle life you had with the battery. Current lithium sulfur cathode makers are trying to mitigate this by using various carbon products to trap the polysulfides before they shuttle away.

But it turns out there is a much more effective way to contain the number 1 problem of polysulfide shuttling. The solution is to pair sulfur based cathodes with sulfide based solid state electrolytes. This 100% filters out any polysulfides shutting all the way to the anode. 100%. Now there likely still is some impact from cathode side only polysulfide shuttling, but we're talking 95% of the problem is solved for you if you can pair sulfur cathode with sulfide electrolyte.

So once again, did I, an anon on twitter just discover this amazing trick that has eluded battery chemists for decades? Of course not. As a conversion style cathode, Sulfur expands and contracts by up to 80% of its volume in charge and discharge. This means that the number one unsolved problem for SSB's, that of interfacial contact between the layers, becomes virtually impossible to do with sulfur based cathodes making the point moot. 

But what if you have a battery architecture that can easily add in extremely high stack pressure in such a way that the expansion is controlled. The interface between the particles even in a sulfur cathode are perfectly uniform and perfectly in contact with a sulfide based electrolyte? That's exactly what Enovix can do. 

But sulfur's amazing potential isn't purely held back by polysulfide shuttling. It also is known for very low power output. We're talking 0.1 C power output (weak sauce), when the batteries required for drones are going to need to be on the order of 10C. This is where the work of the cathode manufacturers pairing it with new types of easily made carbon are making massive amounts of progress. Multiple companies and universities are now testing lithium sulfur based cathodes that are both high capacity and high power now, unheard of only a few years ago.

The next downside to sulfur unfortunately is volumetric density. Gravimetrically it is untouchable. Volumetrically it is weak. Cathode makers have to use low sulfur loading to increase its power output and also a lot of binder to glue it together during its expansion and contraction. In addition, they try to space it out pretty far apart to allow for said expansion and contraction. Once again, the Enovix high stack pressure can make a dramatic difference here. It can greatly reduce the amount of binder required, and the mechanical system is designed for the stuff to be packed in tight, because it is a conversion class battery designed to handle the swell.

The final problem I will discuss is one of heat. All Enovix investors know, the secret to extreme fast charge is rapid and uniform heat extraction from the center of the cell during charging. Fast charge brings in a ton of resistive heating related to bringing all that power in at once. But lesser known, is the fact that most intercalating cathode materials have a slightly endothermic reaction when the cathode gives up the lithium during charging. This means the chemical reaction that occurs during charging of say an LCO cathode, actually reduces the heat in the cell not adds to it. But sulfur is different. When it gives up the lithium, that multi stage reaction is exothermic at every stage. Meaning, if you want to fast charge you now have to get the resistive heat (resistive heat is why a toaster gets hot) out as well as the heat from the chemical reaction itself. And to add pain to this equation, if you're doing all of this in a solid state battery, you don't have a liquid that can rapidly transfer the heat from the center of the cell to the edge. If you don't have a battery form factor/architecture specifically designed for rapid heat extraction, you are going to create hotspots that kill the cycle life of your battery.

Hopefully now you are starting to see why having a battery that can provide high stack pressure and extreme thermal control is not just a nice to have, but is absolutely crucial to making this type of battery work.

I used daily returns since the start of 2025.

I find that these stocks are the 10 stocks *most* sensitive to tariff news:

How should you interpret these results?

Well, for example, if on August 1 Trump announces something that makes the S&P 500 shoot up, then APA Corporation is expected to shoot up by 0.83 (beta to market) + 1.32 (beta to tariffs) = 2.15 that amount! So if the S&P 500 goes up by 5%, APA Corporation is expected to go up by 10.75%! This also works the other way around: if news comes out that makes the market go down, the companies *sensitive* to this news will go down more.

The companies that are least sensitive are expected to go the other way. For example, if the S&P 500 goes *down* by 1% because of new tariff changes, Molina Healthcare is expected to move by 0.75% - 0.85% = -0.10% in the other direction. Hence, it will actually go up slightly!

In other words, when tariff news is released, the *sensitive* stocks co-move with the market (no matter if up or down), the *insensitive* stocks barely move, or move opposite to the market.

How should you interpret these results?

Well, for example, if on August 1 Trump announces something that makes the S&P 500 shoot up, then APA Corporation is expected to shoot up by 0.83 (beta to market) + 1.32 (beta to tariffs) = 2.15 that amount! So if the S&P 500 goes up by 5%, APA Corporation is expected to go up by 10.75%! This also works the other way around: if news comes out that makes the market go down, the companies *sensitive* to this news will go down more.

The companies that are least sensitive are expected to go the other way. For example, if the S&P 500 goes *down* by 1% because of new tariff changes, Molina Healthcare is expected to move by 0.75% - 0.85% = -0.10% in the other direction. Hence, it will actually go up slightly!

In other words, when tariff news is released, the *sensitive* stocks co-move with the market (no matter if up or down), the *insensitive* stocks barely move, or move opposite to the market.

Some analysts are saying Cisco might be a great buy given it is undervalued compared to other AI infrastructure plays. But is it an AI play or just another cautionary tale? Some questions:

* How exciting is the partnership with Nvidia? Nvidia has their own networking products so how will this work? Will Nvidia end up just using Cisco's connections to get in front of Enterprise customers and then just bypass Cisco a few years from now after Nvidia lays the foundations?

* Cisco is bragging that they've hit their $1 billion revenue with hyperscaler goal a quarter early. Is this sustainable? How excited should a Cisco investor be about this? 

* During a joint interview, Jensen said Nvidia and Cisco will work to ""rerack"" all the Enterprise networks because the new agentic AI is going to need different equipment. They estimated this is a 2-4 trillion market opportunity. Do you believe this? Has this already been priced into Cisco?

* Cisco ""wants to unify Management, Identity, Security, IoT, and Monitoring with Networking and they are farther along than any other company"" (credit u/idleline). Do you agree with this statement? Is this a clear competitive advantage not yet priced into the stock?

Overall Cisco seems like it might be where Oracle was last year. A cheap way to get into AI picks and shovels play. On the other hand, lots of people on Reddit seems to dislike Cisco for it's expensive prices and confusing/predator licensing. || Port of Los Angeles sees record container traffic as shippers race to beat Trump‚Äôs tariff deadlines 
https://www.cnbc.com/2025/07/14/port-of-los-angeles-record-container-traffic-trade-war-shipping-tariffs.html

KEY POINTS

The Port of Los Angeles says that shipping container traffic has increased as importers race to beat the latest deadlines set by President Trump for tariffs.

Trade from China, while short of a Covid-like surge, has been up ahead of the mid-August deadline for a deal which could raise tariffs on Chinese goods to 145%.

The Port of Los Angeles reported its best June ever for shipping container traffic, an increase in ocean freight that port executives described as a tariff whipsaw effect, with shippers racing to beat President Trump‚Äôs trade taxes, especially a mid-August deadline for tariffs on Chinese goods.

A total of 892,340 twenty-foot equivalent units (TEUs) were processed at the Port of Los Angeles in June, containers that were filled with holiday season and consumer replenishment products. The increase in containers was not a surprise after President Trump lowered the 145% tariff on Chinese goods to 45%. 

The deadline for the tariff negotiations with China is currently set for August 12. An increase in U.S. manufacturing orders from China during the pause helped fuel China‚Äôs trade surplus to $114.7 billion last month.

Port of LA Executive Director Gene Seroka said that more than anything else, the monthly data highlights the tariff whipsaw effect. Imports had slowed significantly in May and continued to drop through the first half of June.

‚ÄúShifting timelines simply mean shifting volume and more uncertainty here at the Port of LA,‚Äù said Seroka. ‚ÄúLooking into August, if everything holds the way we see it right now, I expect volume to ease because of those new tariffs being in place, making it more costly for American importers,‚Äù he said, citing a National Retail Federation forecast for a double-digit percentage drop in cargo volume from August through November at U.S. ports.

For importers, even amid the trade war pause, the cost of the mounting tariffs has been significant for their businesses.

Bobby Djavaheri, president of Yedi Houseware, told CNBC during a monthly container update call hosted by the Port of Los Angeles that the layering of China tariffs plus stainless steel tariffs has greatly increased the tariff bill his firm is paying on air fryers and other kitchen appliances.

‚ÄúBefore the tariffs, one load would have cost between $1,500 to $2,000. Now it‚Äôs between $40,000-$50,000,‚Äù said Djavaheri.

>

>The bitcoin holdings now account for about two-thirds of Trump Media‚Äôs total liquid assets, the company said in a press release.

>

>Trump Media shares popped as high as 9% when markets opened Monday. They were up around 4% at 2 p.m. ET.

>

>Trump‚Äôs stake in the company - which trades on the Nasdaq under his initials, DJT - is worth nearly $2.3 billion.

>

>The announcement offered the latest marker of how Trump and his family have embraced digital currency to such a degree that cryptocurrency now accounts for most of the president‚Äôs wealth on paper, according to a Forbes analysis from June.

>

>Trump, once a digital-currency skeptic, has vowed to make the U.S. the world‚Äôs cryptocurrency capital. He has already taken multiple steps in that direction by signing an executive order to establish a ‚Äústrategic bitcoin reserve,‚Äù appointing a ‚Äúcrypto czar‚Äù and urging Congress to pass multiple crypto-related bills.

>

>Trump on Friday signed one of those bills, the GENIUS Act, into law after it passed with bipartisan support in the House.

>Trump has made millions more from other cryptocurrency ventures, including the decentralized finance entity World Liberty Financial and the meme coin $TRUMP, whose initial coin release came just days before his inauguration.

>

>The Trump family, which owns much of World Liberty through a business entity, has made about $500 million since the venture‚Äôs launch in September, according to a Reuters analysis.

>

>Trump‚Äôs spokespeople have said that the president‚Äôs connection to World Liberty does not create a conflict of interest because his assets are in a trust that is currently managed by his son, Donald Trump Jr.

>

>But assets in that revocable trust still belong ‚Äúindirectly‚Äù to the president, who is the trust‚Äôs grantor and its sole beneficiary. And the funds would be available to him after he leaves office in 2029.

>

>Critics, including Democratic lawmakers and ethics experts, warn that Trump‚Äôs crypto interests and his political power create an environment ripe for corruption.

>

>‚ÄúAs a stakeholder in crypto assets, President Trump will likely profit from the very policies he is pursuing,‚Äù the advocacy group Democracy Defenders Fund said in a report in April.

>

>Before taking office in January, Trump transferred all DJT shares to the revocable trust managed by Trump Jr. Since then, Trump Media has effectively redefined itself as a cryptocurrency and financial services company.

>

>The company‚Äôs first product was the Twitter-like social media platform Truth Social, which is used by Trump but has failed to generate much revenue. The company, which went public last year through a merger with a special purpose acquisition company, nevertheless attracted thousands of retail investors.

>

>In late January, the company announced a fintech brand called [Truth.Fi](http://Truth.Fi), boosted by a $250 million allocation in investments including bitcoin and exchange-traded funds.

>

>In February, the company began pursuing what it called a ‚Äústrategic acquisition fund with select investors,‚Äù and in March it inked a partnership with [Crypto.com](http://Crypto.com) to launch a series of ETFs.

>

>In late May, the company said it raised over $2.3 billion in net proceeds from selling stock and convertible notes to about 50 institutional investors, and that it would use those funds to build a bitcoin treasury.

>

>Trump Media‚Äôs announcement Monday morning came less than a week after bitcoin hit an all-time high, making it by far the world‚Äôs most valuable and popular cryptocurrency.

>

>The asset jumped past $120,000 as investors anticipated Congress would pass new U.S. crypto legislation to establish a clearer regulatory framework for the nascent industry.

>

>‚ÄúWe‚Äôre rigorously implementing our publicly announced strategy and fulfilling our bitcoin treasury plan,‚Äù Trump Media CEO Devin Nunes said in Monday‚Äôs release.

>

>‚ÄúThese assets help ensure our Company‚Äôs financial freedom, help protect us against discrimination by financial institutions, and will create synergies with the utility token we‚Äôre planning to introduce across the Truth Social ecosphere,‚Äù Nunes said.

I had like $40 sitting my account and bought some GoPro stock at around $.77/ share. Yeah I know the company has issues (burning through cash, losing market share, no clear future vision etc.) but I love my GoPro, and think there is definitely some value in the brand and a possibility for a turnaround of the stock.

That being said, wtf is going on with GPRO? It's up \~17% today and \~50% since last week. I haven't heard of any big announcements from the company, nor do I see any big institutions/ firms buying up shares...

Edit- it‚Äôs up in the after hours to around $2.20. Obviously there‚Äôs a pump and dump scheme going on here (NO IM NOT A PART OF IT). This is the best trade I‚Äôve ever made in my life - **I‚Äôm up 174% (with my 10 shares @ $.77, that‚Äôs a $13.55 profit üòé)** || I calculated which stocks are most sensitive to tariff news In preparation for the August 1 tariff deadlines, I think it's important to know which stocks are most and least sensitive to tariff-related news. This will allow us to select exactly the stocks that will change the most when new tariff changes are announced, or buy the ones that are least sensitive to hedge your position or profit from the opposite direction.

To calculate the sensitivity of stocks to this news, I first looked at which trading days the returns of the S&P 500 were dominated by tariff announcements. I used [this New York Times article](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/13/business/economy/trump-tariff-timeline.html) to find the days on which important announcements were made. If the news was on a non-trading day, I then assumed the next trading day was impacted by the news.

I then regressed the daily returns of each stock in the S&P 500 on the S&P 500 itself (to calculate the market beta), and on a vector that contains the returns of the S&P 500 when there are important tariff announcements, and 0 otherwise (to calculate the beta to tariff news). I used daily returns since the start of 2025.

I find that these stocks are the 10 stocks *most* sensitive to tariff news:

| Company Name                              | Beta to Market | Beta to Tariffs |

How should you interpret these results?

Well, for example, if on August 1 Trump announces something that makes the S&P 500 shoot up, then APA Corporation is expected to shoot up by 0.83 (beta to market) + 1.32 (beta to tariffs) = 2.15 that amount! So if the S&P 500 goes up by 5%, APA Corporation is expected to go up by 10.75%! This also works the other way around: if news comes out that makes the market go down, the companies *sensitive* to this news will go down more.

The companies that are least sensitive are expected to go the other way. For example, if the S&P 500 goes *down* by 1% because of new tariff changes, Molina Healthcare is expected to move by 0.75% - 0.85% = -0.10% in the other direction. Hence, it will actually go up slightly!

In other words, the *sensitive* stocks co-move with the market (no matter if up or down), the *insensitive* stocks barely move, or move opposite to the market.

Use this to your advantage!

I can share the code and data with those that are interested, let me know. || Requesting Complete Breakdown of US Trading Fees and Taxes Hey guys, I want to inquire about the costs of trading in the US market. Can anyone provide a complete breakdown of all fees and charges including: (1) what brokers charge for buying/selling securities (both per-transaction and percentage-based fees), (2) all government taxes applied (both when executing trades and holding long-term), and (3) what percentage of capital typically goes to these costs? Specifically, I'm looking for details on brokerage commissions, SEC fees, capital gains taxes (short-term vs long-term), and any other charges that apply when getting stocks into your account and maintaining positions. A full example breakdown for a typical $100 trade would be especially helpful. Thank you for the detailed information! || Advise needed about Edward Jones and Morgan Stanley A close relative of mine has accounts with Edward Jones‚Äôs and Morgan Stanley. He is very unhappy with everything about Morgan Stanley (treatment, investment knowledge of the advisor assigned, etc. ) on the other hand, he is very satisfied with the Edward Jones‚Äô advisor. 

This person asked me my thoughts about these two investment houses. Honestly, I‚Äôm a fan of Fidelity, Schwab and vanguard. Mainly because of the amount of data they make available to the investor! I‚Äôve never invested with Morgan Stanley nor Edward Jones. What are your experiences of these two?

What are your thoughts about these two legacy investment houses?  || Changing my 401k investment? Currently have my 401k invested in a target date fund for 2055 with an expense ratio of .75. 

I was thinking of switching to iShares S&P 500 Index Fund - Class A. Expense ratio of .35. 

I‚Äôm 33 and intend to work for at least another 20-25 years. I enjoy my career. Would it be wise to increase my risk tolerance and lower my expense ratio at my age? || Statistically GOOG probably tanks on earnings Price before earnings represents the dealer hedge against the bet. Because people are betting on a price drop, say from $168 to $150. The dealer instead has to raise the price to $186, otherwise there's a free ""arbitrage"" to earn ""free money"". (A bet that the move is $18 == a hedge of $18 favoring the dealer so they take the spread at the trade and are neutral to the price).

So while not always true, especially in legitimately unexpected earnings results; when price rises into earnings, big money is betting against the earnings.

When price falls into earnings, big money is betting for the earnings.

It's very simple sports-betting type stuff.

If you look at GOOGs own earnings history you can see that about 75% of the time the Earnings marked a top where price rose, or a bottom where price fell into earnings. So just there you see a roughly 75% chance that GOOG's price falls after earnings over the next quarter.

PS - as the first commenter points out. It does not necessarily mean ""sell everything chicken little"". But if you want to play earnings it's probably better to wait and DCA if the price goes down on your favored stocks. Rather than try to play a rally that you won't sell anyway because \*YOU\* are probably a typical investor who buys and holds.

In the case of GOOG, I'd wait and see regardless. I don't see a point in buying it at this price. And I think weak tech earnings will signal an earnings recession anyway. Which will terrify the markets given EVERYTHING else we have going on. || How does a stock have a share be worth millions?    I was looking at Volcon to invest, and saw that in the initial years the stock was listed the price was around 4.6 million then dropped dramatically to 16 per share now. 

   I see that the stock was spilt a few times. A 5, 45, 100, then twice more 8 times. I know that drives the price down and increases shares but does this type of history say that the company is doing something scummy or something I should watch out for? Or is this a normal thing that happens to stocks sometimes? || [DD] The Value Play Cycle Needs Its Third: Why I'm Betting on DNUT Alright degenerates, we need to talk. OPEN ripped. KSS followed.

# The Setup: OPEN your ahole and KSS DNUTz

Yeah, I went there. But while everyone's drunk on the first two gains, there's a $560M market cap company trading at bankruptcy multiples despite growing revenue.

**Current Price: $3.58**  
**Market Cap: $560M**  
**My Target: $8-12**

Show me another 2-3x opportunity this obvious.

Yet DNUT is:

* Posted 5% organic growth in FY2024
* Has one of the most recognized brands in food

Find me another company this disconnected from fundamentals.

# The Bear Cases Are All Weak

**""Ozempic will kill fast food""** \- I'm a fatass myself and there's no amount of Ozempic that removes my craving for hot, fresh donuts at 2am. Look at MCD and CMG at ATHs. People on Ozempic eat less, not never. A glazed donut is 190 calories of pure dopamine - that demand isn't disappearing.

**""The McDonald's deal ended!""** \- No, the TEST ended after rolling out to 2,400 stores. You think McDonald's spent millions on infrastructure for a 3-month trial? They're analyzing data. If it worked (spoiler: donuts + coffee = money), this goes nationwide.

**""They suspended the dividend!""** \- Good. They're investing in growth instead of paying boomers. That's exactly what you want in a turnaround.

# Three Ways This Plays Out

**Starting Point:**

* Stock: $3.58
* Market Cap: $560M
* Growing business with fixable issues

**Scenario 1: Modest Re-rate (12x EBITDA)**

Still way below peers:

* **Target: $8-9**
* **Return: 125-150%**

**Scenario 2: Industry Average (15x)**

If operations improve:

* **Target: $11-13**
* **Return: 200-250%**

**Scenario 3: Nothing Changes (10x)**

Status quo maintained:

* **Target: $5-6**
* **Return: 40-70%**

Even the bear case would be a healthy return on your money. Show me better risk/reward.

* **McDonald's test ""ended""** ‚Üí Infrastructure built, awaiting expansion
* **Debt concerns** ‚Üí Manageable at 5x EBITDA, becomes nothing if margins improve

Every QSR turnaround story looks exactly like this before the re-rate.

# But Here's Where I Need Your Input

I'm convinced DNUT is the third play because:

1. **Valuation** \- It's the most undervalued name I can find
2. **Size** \- Small enough to move like OPEN and KSS did
3. **Catalysts** \- McDonald's decision, margin improvements, M&A potential
4. **Meme factor** \- The ticker alone guarantees viral potential
5. **Options flow** \- Big money is already positioning

# Someone's Already Loading - Check the Options Flow

Here's what really got my attention: MASSIVE call buying the past few days, absolutely exploding today. The $5 strikes are getting hammered with volume.

Someone with deep pockets is betting big on a move above $5. That's a 40% move from here, and they're paying premium for it. When smart money moves this aggressively on a small cap, you pay attention.

# The Play

The options market is telling you something. When you see this kind of call buying on a beaten-down small cap with clear catalysts, it usually means someone knows something.

Those $5 calls? If DNUT hits just the LOW end of fair value ($8), those are 10-15x. If it hits $12? Those calls print harder than JPow in 2020.

I like the 11/21 $5 call. IV is only at 87% and volume is sufficient at 2k+

The first two already ran. Don't be late to the third.

Because when McDonald's announces the national rollout, when margins tick up even 100bps, when some PE firm offers 15x EBITDA - this thing gaps to $8+ overnight.

 || Muted Results but Booming Guidance: NVDA Q2 Earnings Analysis **TL;DR at the bottom--I broke my wrist touching grass last weekend so this** ***is*** **the short version**

This is my third consecutive quarter posting an independent analysis of NVDA‚Äôs quarterly earnings. My Q4 FY25 and Q1 FY26 estimates are available on my profile, and a comparison to analyst consensus and actual results in those quarters can be seen below.

[Note 2025Q1 Refers to Non-GAAP H20 Excluded](https://preview.redd.it/mmfycac78bef1.png?width=600&format=png&auto=webp&s=4f6bdebbe39904b4b4e944ef04c1020325685bdf)

[While Analysts Consistently Underestimate Revenue, My Bullish Bias has Decreased Significantly](https://preview.redd.it/zvdf6kug8bef1.png?width=848&format=png&auto=webp&s=bf6b37820b364715f26fbff6c646388c7c67959d)

On last quarter's earnings call, the Company guided for a considerable slowdown in revenue growth. They noted that the forecast included a negative impact of $8 billion from losing access to China. Jensen was particularly open on the call, saying,

‚ÄúOn export control... the platform that wins China is positioned to lead globally. Today, however, the $50 billion China market is effectively closed to U.S. industry.‚Äù

Jensen has been consistently meeting with Trump and his administration to get back into China. As recently as July 14th, NVDA provided a positive update on this disruption in a blog post, telling investors they are going to regain the ability to do so soon. Unfortunately, this will likely not affect revenue in Q2, but could lead to optimism from The Company when issuing guidance for Q3 and beyond.

Like in Q1, I will analyze each of the four main revenue segments and create a combined estimate. Since the Data Center segment is both the largest and in the spotlight, I will start there. 

# Data Center Estimate:

When issuing guidance, Colette Kress (CFO) stated the following: ‚ÄúTotal revenue is expected to be $45 billion, plus or minus 2%. We expect modest sequential growth across all of our platforms. In Data Center, we anticipate the continued ramp of Blackwell to be partially offset by a decline in China revenue.‚Äù  
  
The Blackwell ramp is expected to be completely recognized this quarter, yet the segment is set to only experience ‚Äúmodest growth‚Äù due to being locked out of China. The H20 sales halt hit with about three weeks left in Q1, and revenue grew 9.83% QoQ. NVDA still does not have the license required to sell in China, with less than two weeks left in Q2. A re-acceleration of growth seems unlikely this quarter, and my initial estimate is closer to 5-7% growth (\~$41 to $42 billion).¬†

[The Graph Shows Revenue from Data Centers Since 2024Q1 and Highlights the Deceleration in 2025Q1.](https://preview.redd.it/7n0g32oz8bef1.png?width=600&format=png&auto=webp&s=d31bb77ea496875aa86919a961199b793d099415)

The negative impact from the disruption in China will be the largest in Q2, which suggests a continued slowdown in QoQ growth. $41.5 billion would represent just over 6% growth, and with the current data and outlook, it will serve as the preliminary estimate.

# Gaming Estimate:

The rebound in gaming revenue in Q1 outpaced even the most bullish estimates. The record $3.8 billion in Q1 revenue represented a \~50% QoQ increase and was over 15% higher than the previous record. The report cites strength from the partnership with Nintendo (Switch 2) and the CFO noted, ‚ÄúStrong adoption by gamers, creatives, and AI enthusiasts.‚Äù The gaming beat helped NVDA‚Äôs headline revenue total in Q1, and The Company is optimistic strength will continue. However, given the cyclical nature of gaming and Q1 being such a positive surprise, it is difficult to project further QoQ growth to another record. $3.5 billion in Q2 would achieve 20% YoY growth in this segment and will serve as the preliminary estimate.

[Visualization of Strong Rebound in Gaming Revenue in 2025Q1](https://preview.redd.it/a001knqd9bef1.png?width=600&format=png&auto=webp&s=73ce824ea06d28dd1f08ba742e551b97b7cd20ec)

# Prof. Visualization / Robotics & Auto Estimate:

In the interest of time, and given that these two segments combined for barely over $1 billion in Q1, these two segments are being bundled into one breakdown. Prof. Visualization was mentioned by the CFO on the conference call and is expected to return to QoQ growth after being flat in Q1. Robotics & Auto was down sequentially in Q1 but still up over 70% YoY. There was no mention of expectations in Q2. I currently have \~$1.15 billion for the two segments combined, and will look to fine-tune this closer to the release date.

# Total Revenue Estimate: $46.15 Billion



# Earnings Estimate:

On the Q1 report, NVDA added a Non-GAAP EPS line that specifically excluded the H20 charge. It came in at $0.96 per share, surpassing the consensus of $0.93 but falling $0.01 short of my $0.97 estimate. 

There was some initial confusion surrounding the three metrics as ‚Äúregular‚Äù Non-GAAP EPS came in at $0.81, much higher than the Factset analyst consensus of $0.73. 

In Q2, NVDA will likely return to reporting the standard two EPS metrics, and yahoo finance lists the average estimate from 40 analysts at $1.00 per share. The earnings whisper number is a bit lower at $0.94, while the highest estimate from a single analyst is $1.09. 

While it is relatively easy to find consensus estimates for headline figures like EPS and Total Revenue, most analysts do not break out revenue by segment nor show how they convert top-line revenue to bottom-line profitability. This analysis shows the full process of forecasting revenue by segment and how it translates to the bottom-line in a form of unique transparency. 

The last section established the revenue estimate, but to get to EPS, estimates need to be made for gross margin, operating expenses, non-operating expenses, and total shares outstanding. 

NVDA‚Äôs company-issued guidance for both gross margin and operating expenses has been largely reliable in recent quarters. In Q2, the company expects gross margin of 72% and operating costs of $4 billion, which are used in this estimate. 

The company does not issue guidance for non-operating expenses nor shares outstanding, but accurate estimates can be obtained. 

[Stabilization of Cost Increases in 2024 with uptick in 2025Q1](https://preview.redd.it/ulf2s2nz9bef1.png?width=600&format=png&auto=webp&s=38ed7a3d33b88cfaf4134645ffd638b043f67ca7)

The above graph shows historical data for non-operating expenses and QoQ growth for the segment. The growth rate has largely stabilized compared to previous years, even with an uptick in Q1. $4.0 billion would represent a decrease back to about 5% growth, while my current estimate of $4.1 billion represents an increase of just under 8%.¬†

Estimating shares outstanding can be tricky, as the company‚Äôs share repurchase program is inconsistent. NVDA still has about $25 billion authorized under the current plan for share repurchases, but that is down after aggressive buybacks in Q1.¬†

This analysis estimates about $9 billion in buybacks in Q2, reducing the shares outstanding from 24.61 to 24.55 billion (60m shares @ 150 = $9 B). The estimate is similar to the amount repurchased in Q4 and is lower than repurchases in Q1.¬†  


[EPS Calculation Visualized, While Highlighting Opaqueness of Consensus](https://preview.redd.it/kglfaixaabef1.png?width=1924&format=png&auto=webp&s=8d95f34e8f6bf00b14d87a7d6d645d9e400bb658)

The calculation comes out to $1.02 EPS, which is slightly above the average analyst‚Äôs expectations. $46.15 billion in revenue is also only slightly above the consensus.¬†

This is the closest my estimates have been to the consensus, which has been surpassed each of the last 10 quarters. Given that I expect relatively muted results this quarter, guidance for the rest of the year will be in focus during the call.¬†

# Guidance:

After the positive update on China sales, investors are looking for strong guidance. While it‚Äôs not as straightforward as adding the lost $8 billion back into the forecast, analysts are expecting the worst to be in the past. Investors are looking for signs that the ‚Äústart of the new wave‚Äù Jensen mentioned last quarter will materialize this year.¬†

The current expectation for Q3 revenue is \~$51.5 billion, an increase of 13% from Q2 expectations ($45.55). In Q1, revenue grew 10% QoQ to $44.06 billion. This means analysts expect just over 3% growth in the current quarter with notable re-acceleration in Q3.¬†

Analysts are looking for at least a piece of the Chinese market in Q3 with the $51.5 billion forecast. Q2 guidance would have been closer to $53 billion with full access to China, suggesting the Q3 forecast still projects some disruption in China near term.¬†

If NVDA signals a faster-than-expected ramp in sales to China, guidance expectations that already look strong could still be too low. However, any delays in the licensing process or misaligned inventory could dampen Q3‚Äôs forecast.¬†

# Valuation:

Regardless of belief in the company, NVDA is expensive right now. ‚ÄúExpensive‚Äù in this case means that it is trading at higher multiples than multi-year averages.¬†

Even using the H20 excluded EPS number from Q1, NVDA has earned $3.34 per share over the last four quarters. Trailing earnings are expected to increase to $3.66 after Q2‚Äôs report, while full year EPS is currently expected to come in at around $4.30.¬†

Based on a current price of \~$173, NVDA is currently trading at over 51x TTM earnings, and 40x forward earnings.

While NVDA has previously traded for 40x forward earnings, it has also traded for closer to 20x forward earnings as recently as this year.¬†

NVDA is also currently experiencing an elevated Price to Sales ratio (higher than 75% of history) of over 28x sales, and its Price to Book ratio of 50x is more expensive than 91% of NVDA‚Äôs history.¬†

Buying NVDA at $170 makes sense only if the company continues to deliver bullish surprises on top of already sky-high expectations. I am not selling shares ahead of the report, even with the price outpacing my targets.¬†

# Positions:

When I began posting NVDA analysis and creating my price targets, NVDA traded for about $140 per share. At the time, I felt the price was fair, and it wasn‚Äôt until the liberation day tariff sell-off to sub $90 that I began buying more aggressively.¬†

I currently own 200 shares with a cost basis around $125. While I expected NVDA to recover rather quickly, the near 100% rally from April lows leads me to believe hype and FOMO are driving the price higher rather than fundamental growth. While NVDA‚Äôs growth has been explosive, the current price leaves no room for negative catalysts.¬†

Based on my expectations for NVDA in the rest of 2025, I sold an ATM covered call expiring in December. I am willing to sell at $175 between now and the end of the year, so I decided to collect $3000 ($1500 x2) selling that call option. I now have $15 of downside protection through December or will sell my shares for a massive profit.¬†

The next lowest ask is $110. Sarah buys only 10 shares at $110. She pays $1100, and that money goes to the seller asking for $110. However, at this point the market posts XYZ value as $110.

This what bugs me. Doesn't that mean Joe will see his portfolio has gone up 10%, and now showing $11,000, where that extra $1000 is actually just an inflated value? Until Joe sells them, and someone is willing to pay 100 shares at $110, that $1000 is not really there.

Hackers have breached about 400 government agencies, corporations and other groups, according to estimates from Eye Security, the Dutch cybersecurity company that identified an early wave of the attacks last week. That‚Äôs up from roughly 60 based on its previous estimate provided to Bloomberg News on Tuesday.

The security firm said that most of the victims are in the US, followed by Mauritius, Jordan, South Africa and the Netherlands. The National Nuclear Security Administration, the US agency responsible for maintaining and designing the nation‚Äôs cache of nuclear weapons, was among those breached, Bloomberg reported earlier.

The hacks are among the latest major breaches that Microsoft has blamed, at least in part, on China and come amid heightened tensions between Washington and Beijing over global security and trade. The US has repeatedly criticized China for campaigns that have allegedly stolen government and corporate secrets over a period spanning decades.

‚ÄúWe estimate that the real number might be much higher as there can be many more hidden ways to compromise servers that do not leave traces,‚Äù Eye Security‚Äôs co-owner Vaisha Bernard said in an email to Bloomberg News. ‚ÄúThis is still developing, and other opportunistic adversaries continue to exploit vulnerable servers.‚Äù

The organizations compromised in the SharePoint breaches include many working in government, education, and technology services, Bernard said. There were smaller numbers of victims in countries across Europe, Asia, the Middle East and South America.

US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, who is set to meet his Chinese counterparts in Stockholm next week for a third round of trade talks, suggested in a Bloomberg Television interview Wednesday that the SharePoint hacks will be discussed. ‚ÄúObviously things like that will be on the agenda with my Chinese counterparts,‚Äù he said.

The security flaws allow hackers to access SharePoint servers and steal keys that can let them impersonate users or services, potentially enabling deep access into compromised networks to steal confidential data. Microsoft has issued patches to fix the vulnerabilities, but researchers cautioned that hackers may have already got a foothold into many servers.

Microsoft on Tuesday accused Chinese state-sponsored hackers known as Linen Typhoon and Violet Typhoon of being behind the attacks. Another hacking group based in China, which Microsoft calls Storm-2603, also exploited them, according to the company.

The Redmond, Washington company has repeatedly blamed China for major cyberattacks. In 2021, an alleged Chinese operation compromised tens of thousands of Microsoft Exchange servers. In 2023, another alleged Chinese attack on Microsoft Exchange compromised senior US officials‚Äô email accounts. A US government review later accused Microsoft of a ‚Äúcascade of security failures‚Äù over the 2023 incident.

Eugenio Benincasa, a researcher at ETH Zurich‚Äôs Center for Security Studies who specializes in analyzing Chinese cyberattacks, said members of the groups identified by Microsoft had previously been indicted in the US for their alleged involvement in hacking campaigns targeting US organizations. They are well known for their ‚Äúextensive espionage,‚Äù he said.

It‚Äôs likely that the SharePoint breaches are being carried out by proxy groups that work with the government rather than Chinese government agencies directly carrying out the hacking, according to Benincasa. Private hacking companies in the country sometimes participate in ‚Äúhacker for hire‚Äù operations, he added.

‚ÄúNow that at least three groups have reportedly exploited the same vulnerability, it‚Äôs plausible more could follow,‚Äù he said.

‚ÄúCybersecurity is a common challenge faced by all countries and should be addressed jointly through dialogue and cooperation,‚Äù said Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Guo Jiakun. ‚ÄúChina opposes and fights hacking activities in accordance with the law. At the same time, we oppose smears and attacks against China under the excuse of cybersecurity issues.‚Äù

According to Microsoft, the hacking group Linen Typhoon was first identified in 2012, and is focused on stealing intellectual property, primarily targeting organizations related to government, defense, strategic planning, and human rights. Violet Typhoon, first observed in 2015, was ‚Äúdedicated to espionage‚Äù and primarily targeted former government and military personnel, non-governmental organizations, as well as media and education sectors in the US, Europe, and East Asia.

The hackers have also used the SharePoint flaws to break into systems belonging to the US Education Department, Florida‚Äôs Department of Revenue and the Rhode Island General Assembly, Bloomberg previously reported.

Brussels could agree to the so-called reciprocal levies to avoid the US President‚Äôs threat to raise them to 30 per cent from August 1, three people familiar with the situation told the Financial Times.

Both sides would waive tariffs on some products, including aircraft, spirits and medical devices, the people said.

The European Commission, which runs EU trade policy, briefed envoys from member states on Wednesday following talks with US counterparts.

The bloc‚Äôs exporters have been paying an additional 10 per cent tariff on goods sent to the US since April while talks between Washington and Brussels continued. That was on top of pre-existing duties averaging 4.8 per cent.

The people said they understood the 15 per cent minimum tariff would include those existing duties, so Brussels views the deal as cementing the status quo. Tariffs on cars, which are currently 27.5 per cent, would therefore fall to 15 per cent.

The bloc will continue to prepare a possible ‚Ç¨93bn package of retaliatory tariffs, set at up to 30 per cent, in case they cannot agree a deal by August 1, the people said.

A US official said the situation was fluid and subject to change.

And so do ""Econ101"", And your snide remarks don't change anything. A ""Gambler's psychology 101"" course would straighten you out. Markets aren't economic S&D curves. That stuff is for ""ideal lab scenarios"". Markets are behavioral economics at best. And do the opposite what a sterile classroom says should happen because people don't care about fundamentals, they care about results. And they behave panicky and exuberantly in markets.*

Someone asked such a fundamental question that I need to respond with a separate post for a full on discussion.

But, supply increases when price decreases, contrary to ""logic"" because of behavioral economics. The logical thought is the higher the price the more people want to sell but this is not true at all.

Search your own hearts and you'll see quite plainly why. Like gamblers on a winning streak we don't want to quit when we're ahead, we want to double our bets, make even more money, feel even ""better"".

When prices rise, we remove supply because everyone is doing the same thing. They are doubling down, seeing how far it can go, they are complacent, they are squeezing the price even higher self-fulfilling the prophecy that the market can never ever go down.

The opposite is true when prices fall. People become afraid, people sell out of fear of losing their gains, or fear of losing more. Typically the latter.

People are willing to sacrifice gains, they'll hold out hoping for even higher returns. Until they lose all their return, then they are in denial. ""It can't go down forever. It'll come back, surely this will pass"".

And of course, an investor who's survived a few of these will hold. But typically a bottom price is found when ""everyone dumps"".

When everyone throws in the towel and sells at that price. That's a deluge of volume, not a trickle. That's when prices bottom.

When people become so fearful that everyone ends up on the same side of the trade, selling instead of buying.

Behaviorally that's how people create supply in a decreasing price environment.

It's really quite simple when you are just honest with your own behavior. How many of you have ""sold the bottom"" only to feel like a fool because prices came right back?

How many of you have bought the top because  you were over excited and the prices fell and you had to ""wait"" for profit or it never came back to prior highs?

We've all done it.

The point is that EVERYONE does it. And because EVERYONE does it...that's why supply increases when prices fall. And why buyers (demand) increases when prices rise.

I got told an idea and i dont see any big negatives for it. I am hoping you will help me find the downsides

Assuming i have 100 of stock A. lets say the price is 100 dollars each (aka worth 10k). If i am investing long term, so i am not planning to sell. What if i sell covered calls. 1 year in advance, and let say it costs 10 dollars for striking price of $110 per stock.

  
This way, one of three things could happen next year. Either the stock is more than $120, then i am forced to sell it for $110. so my total gain is capped at $12k, or if the stock is less than $110 then at least i got $1K  out of that stock, even though its value is now lower. but since i was planning to hold it long term anyway . i don't care too much 

  
It seems with this, more or less you can guarantee 10% return per year on your stocks. i am thinking of someone who is retired and depends on stocks for income, this seems like a good way to do income without chance of loss. only chance of not gaining as much as you could've. Help me see other down sides on the long run. like compare this method vs a method who holds the stock for 10 years and doing nothing with it. Even if the stock kept flying super high, year after year. You still end up with 10% increase year over year. thats very decent || S&P Gap at 4650 must be filled. Historically, CME gaps are filled on the S&P. Since 1997 no gap exists that hasn't been filled except this one.

There's a rather large, glaring and obviously well placed gap at 4650 that coincides with January 2022 top and August 2023 top.

This gap will be filled and make for a good ""buy the dip price"" in the future. No reason to sit on \~40% gains on the $SPY and risk losing all that annualized return while there's an obvious gap to be filled.

The Gap would represent a retest of prior highs from 2021 period and the ""break out"" from 2021 highs which occurred in 2023. A pretty typical retest that happens in every bull market recovery.

Both the technical and fundamental set-up (34.5% short interest) makes this one of the best opportunities I have seen in a very long while. A price target of 10-15$ is very achievable.**

Two months ago I posted a 408K YOLO into IOVA with ten points of DD (I highly recommend you read this if you haven't already as I outline the basics of the company + main theses there): [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1kqhzj0/408k\_yolo\_into\_iova/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1kqhzj0/408k_yolo_into_iova/)

Since then, the stock has risen over 80% on multiple positive updates and my position grew to 800K (after I also added \~12k shares). I believe that a few recent developments, however, are so substantial that they warrant a new post, and my conviction in the stock has never been higher.

**Fundamentals are improving rapidly - much faster than sell-side and shorts expected:**

1. Replimune's RP1 was IOVA's biggest competitive threat, and the **rejection of their flagship therapy by the FDA yesterday** means that Amtagvi will be able to maintain its monopoly in the late-stage melanoma field: [https://ir.replimune.com/news-releases/news-release-details/replimune-receives-complete-response-letter-fda-rp1-biologics](https://ir.replimune.com/news-releases/news-release-details/replimune-receives-complete-response-letter-fda-rp1-biologics)

Investors who have been following the stock should know just how much of a threat REPL seemed to IOVA, and how bullish the CRL is for IOVA's operations in the next few years. This is especially the case given that IOVA has been trying to make the push into being used at earlier stages. REPL's stock dropping 77.24% yesterday signals the market's belief that they will likely need to redo their study entirely, using randomized controlled studies this time.

2. **Recent commercial data from IOVA has been very, very, very impressive**. A July 14 study found that Amtagvi's ORR among real world patients who have received multiple lines of prior therapies was **49%**. For patients who have received 2 lines of therapies or less, the ORR was **60.9%**: [https://ir.iovance.com/news-releases/news-release-details/real-world-data-demonstrate-49-response-rate-commercial-amtagvir](https://ir.iovance.com/news-releases/news-release-details/real-world-data-demonstrate-49-response-rate-commercial-amtagvir)

This is truly **miracle-drug level numbers for melanoma**, and hence the widespread excitement in the medical industry. Many of these responses were also highly durable lasting many years following a single treatment. In other words, for many patients who have tried and failed other therapies and thus are losing hope, Amtagvi provides a 49% chance of extending your lifespan by years (and a chance of complete recovery). The fact that 250m Americans are covered by insurance for this treatment means that the 500k treatment cost is manageable for consumers, but represents significant revenue for IOVA.

Such data, along with the rejection of RP1, will help them push into earlier lines of therapy, enabling a  rapid revenue ramp up over the coming year. Management forecasts a steady state of 1bn in annual revenue and 80% gross margins - which seems more and more achievable given the RP1 rejection.

3. **Q2 recovery is imminent with a stronger team**. In the Q1 earnings call, management has repeatedly mentioned that Q2 demand was very strong, and that they are capable of beating their lowered guidance. This was reinforced by physician comments during their Investor Event at ASCO where they mentioned that treatments really picked up in April: [https://ir.iovance.com/events/event-details/iovance-biotherapeutics-asco-investor-event](https://ir.iovance.com/events/event-details/iovance-biotherapeutics-asco-investor-event)

**Technicals - one of the most insane short-squeeze set ups I've seen**

1. The stock is currently one of the most heavily shorted tickers out there, with **short interest at 34.53%.** By comparison, OPEN only has a short interest of **20.7%** **and the fundamental improvement of IOVA > OPEN by a significant margin.**

Furthermore, **81.33% of shares are held by institutions** (with 8.41% held by Wayne Rothbaum, one of the most successful biotech investors of all time who also sits on the board), and **17.97% are held by mutual funds**. This means that the amount of shares traded among retail is very limited (0.32% OS), further improving the technical set up and the potential for a squeeze.

**For a short squeeze to not be a short-lived pump and dump, the fundamentals must justify the short squeeze** (many forget this). In this case, it seems that the **hedges who drove the 34.53% short interest has been caught with their pants down**, as the fundamentals improved significantly faster than they expected.

**Let me know your thoughts. This is not financial advice. Pray for me.**  
 || MOST Undervalued hidden gem $GLXY The biggest laggard of all crypto stocks is possibly $GLXY and let me tell you why.

They recently migrated from TSX to NASDAQ. As a result, they have been very muted and frankly novogratz mentioned that they will have more access to capital via US market (aka nobody cares about Canadian stock). 

Now this really is one of the main theses about why this is a hidden gem. There has been a lack of media coverage and analyst coverage because they just got listed on US exchange. In fact, I recently just found out about galaxy digital being on the US exchange as well.

Now let‚Äôs talk about the business and about Mike Novogratz

1) Galaxy Digital is at the intersection of the two biggest narratives in the market right now, which is crypto and HPC. First of all novogratz had the vision. They started off as a BTC miner and Novogratz now, he‚Äôs got the vision to convert all of their compute into a data center as they are in the process of converting all of it into a data center. 

2) HPC/AI Pivot: A major strategic move by Galaxy is its pivot from pure crypto mining into High-Performance Computing. In April 2025, Galaxy inked a 15-year deal with CoreWeave (a fast-growing AI cloud provider) to host AI workloads at Galaxy‚Äôs huge Texas data center campus. Galaxy is converting its former bitcoin mining facility (‚ÄúHelios‚Äù) to provide 133¬†MW of power for CoreWeave‚Äôs AI/HPC servers, to be fully delivered by mid-2026  

3) Crypto Business: In addition to their HPC/AI pivot, Galaxy Digital is also one of the OG crypto businesses which operate in crypto trading, asset management, and investment banking firm in the crypto space.

Galaxy‚Äôs Global Markets division profits from market making and OTC trading for institutions, which flourishes when crypto interest is high Ôøº. Its venture investment portfolio (valued ~$736 million in Q1) includes stakes in many crypto startups ‚Äì as the sector recovers, some of these investments could appreciate or be monetized. 

Galaxy is also capitalizing on increasing institutional adoption of crypto, as more banks and funds enter the space (now over 60% of crypto trading volume is institutional Ôøº). Galaxy‚Äôs recent registration as a U.S. swap dealer and launch of a $160M venture fund are aimed at serving this institutional wave. **And this is only expected to get bigger given the GENIUS act**. 

Also I should mention that Galaxy Digital will also benefit largely from the Stablecoin act as well, and they have been a large supporter of lobbying for support from the government.

So if you are telling me a stock such as BMNR, SBET, BTBT can moon by switching their treasury to ETH, just think about what Galaxy can hold. 

And this is only because of the lack of media coverage on this company.

4) Upcoming Earnings Report: Galaxy Digital is set to report their first earnings report as a US listed stock on Aug 5th (which they moved up ahead of time) and just announced recently. Here is what the expectations are:

In Q1 2025, Galaxy reported a large net loss of $295‚ÄØmillion (‚âà$0.86 per share loss) due to the steep drop in crypto prices during Q1 and a one-time $57‚ÄØM impairment for winding down its mining rigs at Helios Ôøº. By contrast, for Q2 the company provided guidance that, as of mid-Q2, it had already generated $160‚Äì$170‚ÄØmillion in operating income. Moreover the company is expected to announce strong growth outlook in terms of its HPC and Crypto business operations as they are also a market maker/custodian as well. 

**Also one of the most important facts is the fact that Galaxy Digital will be getting more analyst coverage since they just migrated to the US exchange. And by releasing this earnings reports it will provide more guidance for analysts. Right now there are only like ~3 firms which have rated this company as a strong buy**. 

I believe we will see more of this just based on the fact that crypto stocks have done tremendously well because of the GENIUS act.

4) Lastly, everything Novogratz touches turns to gold as well.

5) Another user also posted a DD here (which I won‚Äôt repeat)

https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/s/rqq4iY5U16

TLDR: Galaxy was previously listed on TSX which nobody cares about and as a result, they lacked the proper coverage that US firms does. As they report their earnings on Aug 5th, there will be more analyst coverage who would rate this stock as a strong buy. 

Moreover they will simply have more access to capital because nobody trades on the TSX. As a business that operates at the intersection of AI and crypto, you are telling me that they aren‚Äôt going to moon ?

Position: 24k shares, now take me to the moon Novogratz.

 Bank of America says it was slightly better than expected but also points to downsides from weaker electric car incentives and weaker tariffs have been a downside they're neutral honestly it hard to argue with that in the short term

Barclays is sceptical warning the gap between rhetoric and fundamentals is widening it is A polite way of saying that the FSD hype has yet to be backed by execution 

Stifel are also neutral but they highlight the upcoming FSD v12 release and Austin Taxi expansion as green shoots

Piper Sandler always bullish, called it a solid quarter and questioned the after-hours selloff seeming less concerned about the short-term noise seeing FSD's potential trumping everything else

This was a vision vs reality type of quarter Tesla ambitions for AI and Autopilot are still intact but will take years to realise and in the meantime fundamental demand, margins, and regulatory headwinds remain the top priorities

Canadians increased their net position in US stocks by $14.2 billion in May, more than 4x the volume last year. It was 88% higher than the previous cycle peak in May 2021, and the biggest net increase for the month on record. Only 6 months in the past 37 years of data have seen larger net increases just one prior to 2020, and most within the past two years.¬†

May net investment in US stocks was typically minimal often negative prior to 2020. Pulling out of volatile American markets and reallocating the capital into Canadian investment properties was nearly a national pastime.

But there's an enormous difference just among the top 10 tech stocks by size.

TSLA is trading at a PE of 177 which doesn't make the remotest bit of sense based on the business that they are in (cars) and could be in (robotaxis, robots, and AI), even if they were wildly successful in new business areas (in which they face stiff competition) there is no way to justify the current valuation.

PLTR's PE is over 600 not much more I need to say about that.

GOOG is trading at a PE of 21. Its core search business is going to be disrupted by AI but it is still entrenched and they have the time and resources to adapt. Meanwhile they own the largest streaming platform in YouTube, and arguably the most actually successful robotaxi business in Waymo. If they were ever split up the parts would be worth far more than the sum.

AAPL's heyday is behind it since their growth is anchored in devices and they will probably never acquire significantly more market share in phones meanwhile they have to create a new Fortune 500 sized business every year just to try to keep the growth going.

AMZN on the other hand is not bound by any particular industry or market. They are getting into satellites, pharmaceutical delivery, health care, and can pick any large market they want to address.

MSFT's new leadership after the atrocious Ballmer has brought the company into huge new markets and they are well positioned to capitalize on AI, with a PE of 39 they are not cheap but by far not the most expensive with solid growth prospects.

Thanks in advance! || Is 75% Net Income spent on CAPEX too much for GOOG? In April the narrative was ""Tech is spending too much on CAPEX"". It really impacted companies like MSFT and NVDA which at the time was the right call to call that bluff.

But now, with GOOG coming out declaring it wants to spend upwards of 75% of its net income on CAPEX. Is it too much going forward?

GOOG's CAPEX has increased from a 49% average pre 2016, to a current average of 54.2% of its net income. But now it wants to spend nearly 75% for estimated 2025 Net income. And says it'll increase even more in 2026.

A bigger concern is that all this infrastructure has a high attrition rate. Servers need replacing on a 5 year cycle. So the likelihood expensive buildouts now will persist later is a problem as well.

At what point is the CAPEX expenditure too much?  || Who will buy bonds if interest rates drop? Answer: A lot of people \*EDIT\* Lol it's so comical to me that people think ""Jap"" is a derogatory term. I have to advise that there's even gravestones where I live marking people as ""Japnanee"" - not even using the term ""Japanese"". And these are gravestones both in Japanese Kanji and in Latinized transliteration, made by the people themselves. People here refer to themselves as Japs, Nips, Nihos, Nons, Japanee, and a few other things. Maybe the Woke ""losers"" who think everything is an insult and ""white nationalism"" or whatever, should pull their own heads out of their ass.

The truth is that many people (net) are short bonds. They are short bonds by taking out loans, they are directly short bonds, they are short derivatives of bonds.

Right now, COT reports for CME shorts on bonds, total: == $2.19 Trillion.

The US only needs to roll over $7 Trillion in short term debt, and here you have over $2Trillion in direct short-futures on bonds greater than 2 years.

Just lowering interest rates will liquidate 2/7ths, nearly 1/3rd worth of all US short-term treasuries and bills needing to roll over into long term positions.

So who will buy 1% Treasuries? That guy.

The bozo that is shorting bonds.

Who will buy 1% treasuries? The MBS salesman who packaged a 6% Mortgage tranche and now those mortgages are refinancing at 1%prime rates and needs to be REPACKAGED. How many MBSs exist that need collateral at the new rate? I don't have the answer in front of me, but the answer exists. It's quantifiable with the right data. It's probably over $1Trillion. The Mortgage Securities market is $11 Trillion large.

I'm sure more than $1 Trillion of that market will need to refinance their MBS collaterals with 1% treasuries.

Who else will buy 1% treasuries? The foreigner who earned money exporting plastic-dog-poop keychains to the US and needs to take that dollar and put it anywhere except in currency because of currency risk.

Who will buy bonds at lower interest rates? Answer? Enough people will that the US will continue to be gangster. Anyone betting against the US is and always will be a loser.

Just ask the Japs and the Germans.

Hell, they'll buy the remaining short-duration paper at gunpoint, for 0% yield.

Because Uncle Sam's big ding-dong tells them to with Nuclear Bombs for condoms and Aircraft Carriers for lube.

- **Revenue Driver**: 72% from interchange fees (users swipe debit cards 54x/month).
- **Cost Structure**: $1.4B in marketing (2022-2024) fuels growth, offset by high retention.
- **Profitability**: Q1 2025 profitability is a milestone, though EBITDA margin is -2.22%, indicating room for improvement.

## New Products: Chime+ and Chime Workplace

On March 31, 2025, Chime launched two game-changing updates:

- **Chime+ Premium Membership** (free with qualifying direct deposits):
  - 3.75% APY on savings (vs. 0.45% national average).
  - Custom cashback deals with top retailers, boosting transaction volume.
  - Priority customer support for faster issue resolution.
  - Enhances user engagement and retention. [Source: Chime Newsroom](https://www.chime.com/newsroom/news/chime-launches-premium-membership-tier-and-more-than-a-dozen-new-features-in-redesigned-app/)

- **Chime Workplace**: A financial wellness suite for employers, offering tools to improve employee financial health. With two-thirds of workers seeking such benefits, this B2B play diversifies revenue beyond consumer banking.

These launches, part of a redesigned app with features like FICO score tracking and credit building, strengthen Chime‚Äôs ecosystem.

## MyPay: Disrupting Predatory Lending

Chime‚Äôs MyPay offers $20-$500 paycheck advances with no interest or mandatory fees ($2 for instant access). Compare to:

- Payday loans: Up to 652% interest.
- Credit card advances: 17.99%-29.99% interest.

Targeting fee-sensitive users, MyPay drives loyalty and interchange revenue, disrupting predatory lenders and locking in users for long-term growth.

---

## Business Model: Scalable and Defensible

Chime‚Äôs lean model gives it an edge:

- **No Physical Branches**: Lower overhead vs. traditional banks.
- **Higher Interchange Fees**: Non-bank status avoids regulatory caps.
- **No Credit Risk**: FDIC bank partnerships (e.g., The Bancorp, Stride Bank) eliminate loan losses.
- **Sticky Users**: Direct deposit makes Chime the default bank for 67% of users.

Competitors like SoFi, PayPal, and Square are strong, but Chime‚Äôs focus on the underbanked and no-fee model sets it apart.

## ChimeCore Catalyst: In-House Processing

Chime is transitioning from Galileo Financial Technologies (SoFi-owned, acquired for $1.2B in 2020) to its own processor, **ChimeCore**. By end-2024, credit card transactions moved to ChimeCore, with debit cards likely transitioning by mid-2025. Benefits include:

- **Cost Savings**: Cutting Galileo‚Äôs fees could add millions to the bottom line.
- **Operational Control**: Reduces reliance on SoFi and mitigates outage risks (e.g., Galileo‚Äôs 2019 issues).
- **Market Impact**: Analysts estimate a 20%+ stock pop on completion. [Source: Chime S1 Filing](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1795586/000162828025025059/chimefinancialinc-sx1wq1da.htm)

Execution risks (technical delays, integration costs) exist, but margin expansion potential is significant.

## Analyst Sentiment: Bullish Outlook

Analysts are optimistic, with 13 ‚ÄúBuy‚Äù ratings and a $37.75 average price target (~6% upside from $35.60):

| Analyst            | Rating       | Price Target |

## Options Flow: Bullish Bets

- Heavy volume in $40 calls (30% upside from $35.60) signals institutional interest.
- High volatility (beta 4.79) makes it a WSB-friendly play.
- August 7 earnings could spark a move if Chime beats and raises guidance.

## Bull Case: Why This Could Pop

- **Massive TAM**: <5% penetration, 95% growth runway in a 227M market.
- **Profitable Growth**: 32% revenue growth, Q1 2025 profitability.
- **Innovation**: Chime+ and Chime Workplace drive engagement and new revenue.
- **Catalysts**: August earnings, ChimeCore transition, upmarket expansion.
- **Valuation**: Below IPO high ($43), with analyst targets suggesting upside.

---

## Risks to Consider

- **Economic Sensitivity**: Low-income users may cut spending in a downturn.
- **Competition**: SoFi, PayPal, Square, and adapting banks pose threats.
- **Regulatory Risk**: Potential fee caps could hit interchange revenue.
- **Valuation**: Rich at $11.09B with no P/E (TTM EPS -$0.43).

Not a guaranteed home run, but the setup is solid. **Not financial advice‚Äîdo your own DD.** Let‚Äôs discuss! || Trump raises pressure on countries to open their markets amid tariff talks WASHINGTON, July 23 (Yonhap) -- U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday threatened to impose ""much higher tariffs"" if a trading partner does not open its market, as South Korea and other nations strive to reach trade deals with his administration ahead of the Aug. 1 negotiation deadline.

Trump made the remarks in a social media post, a day after he announced a trade deal with Japan, under which the United States will impose 15 percent ""reciprocal"" tariffs on Japanese goods shipped to the United States -- 10 percentage points lower than what was previously announced.

""I WILL ONLY LOWER TARIFFS IF A COUNTRY AGREES TO OPEN ITS MARKET,"" he wrote on Truth Social. ""IF NOT, MUCH HIGHER TARIFFS! Japan's Markets are now OPEN (for first time ever!). USA BUSINESSES WILL BOOM!.""

His remarks added pressure on South Korea and other trading partners to explore ways to open their markets if they want to reduce the impact of reciprocal tariffs that Trump unveiled in April to address tariff and non-tariff barriers to American exports.

South Korea has been making all-out government efforts to avoid the proposed 25 percent reciprocal tariffs as well as sector-specific tariffs on steel, aluminum and automobiles that would weigh heavily on its export-reliant economy.","wallstreetbets, investing, stocks, StockMarket",14.0,122.33999633789062,115.84500026702881,115.84500026702881

According to Morgan Stanley the case directly threatens the roughly $20 billion-plus that Google pays Apple annually for defaulting to Google's search engine on the iPhone. It's a huge but rarely discussed cash flow that is now coming into focus.

Base case according to MS 

Judge Mehta restricts exclusivity Think of the EU's selection screen 

Google still pays Apple \~2% by 2027 Not a huge but not insignificant impact on Apple's EPS 

Worst case 

Total ban on Google's payments to Apple = 10% reduction in EPS 

Apple could retest April's low 

Extreme case unlikely Apple builds its own search engine MS Says EPS will fall by more than 20% by FY27 

Any decision is likely to go through an appeals process so nothing will change overnight but pricing can start now especially if the market responds to the long term risks ahead of time 

My view Google may ride it out EU shows that even given the choice users will still choose Google AAPL's service margins are more fragile than people think

AAPL,2025-07-24,US,"Not all top 10 tech stocks are the same A lot is being said about the high valuations and long outperformance of the tech stocks and how risky and overvalued they are as a bunch. But there's an enormous difference just among the top 10 tech stocks by size.

TSLA is trading at a PE of 177 which doesn't make the remotest bit of sense based on the business that they are in (cars) and could be in (robotaxis, robots, and AI), even if they were wildly successful in new business areas (in which they face stiff competition) there is no way to justify the current valuation.

PLTR's PE is over 600 not much more I need to say about that.

GOOG is trading at a PE of 21. Its core search business is going to be disrupted by AI but it is still entrenched and they have the time and resources to adapt. Meanwhile they own the largest streaming platform in YouTube, and arguably the most actually successful robotaxi business in Waymo. If they were ever split up the parts would be worth far more than the sum.

AAPL's heyday is behind it since their growth is anchored in devices and they will probably never acquire significantly more market share in phones meanwhile they have to create a new Fortune 500 sized business every year just to try to keep the growth going.

AMZN on the other hand is not bound by any particular industry or market. They are getting into satellites, pharmaceutical delivery, health care, and can pick any large market they want to address.

AMD,2025-07-17,US,"nvidia valuation just doesn't make any sense to me It's at 4.2T right now. It's most valued company on the planet. Yet what do they exactly do? They /design/ compute chips.

Let that sink in - they design those chips, they don't even manufacture them.

Most of those chips today go to AI industry, they used to be a GPU industry leader, but today it's not about graphics anymore, it's just about AI compute. Graphics and gaming is a minor market for them, and companies like AMD can provide better gaming GPU cards for less money. So let's talk about the AI - because then you have companies like Intel and AMD, and Google with their own TPUs and then you have China which is according to various sources maybe about 2 - 5 years behind, but ultimately trying to be able to both design and manufacture such chips too.

So:

nvidia - valued at 4.2T capable only of designing powerful compute chips, being currently most popular by AI researchers because their CUDA software stack is already widely adopted and mature

Intel - valued at \~100B capable of **both designing and manufacturing** comparably powerful compute chips - not having so mature ecosystem as CUDA - yet  
AMD - valued at \~250B capable of only designing compute chips just as powerful as nvidia, only lacking in adoption of their software stack (ROCm) that they keep improving (they already provide accelerators cards even more powerful than nvidia)

TSMC - valued at 1.2T which is manufacturing for most of chip designers, now including even Intel (partially) that nvidia is totally dependent on

Then you have companies like Google and Cerebras that design their own silicon (again depending on TSMC just as everyone else, maybe except Chinese) that make chips far more powerful than nvidia does.

So where is this insane valuation of nvidia coming from? Is it just because they have a temporary leading edge in industry that just seems to be a top of all hype?

Because in few years they could literally become irrelevant in the AI world just as Nokia became irrelevant in the mobile phone world - the competition exists, has similar products, and it's only a matter of short time until software stacks for Intel and AMD GPUs get as much adopted in LLM / AI world as CUDA is.

Can someone help me understand this valuation? || TSMC just crushed Q2. Here‚Äôs why I‚Äôm still holding (and glad I bought the dip at $145) I‚Äôve had TSM in the portfolio for a while now (wrote a deep dive on it ages ago which still holds up). Earlier this year, when everyone freaked out over tariffs and the stock dipped to \~$145, I flagged it as a chance to load up. I bumped it to over 5% of the portfolio.

Fast forward to Q2 2025 earnings ‚Ä¶yeah. No regrets.

The numbers slapped:

* Revenue: $31.67B, up 54% YoY ü§Ø
* Net income: $9.2B, up 60%
* EPS: $2.47 (beat by $0.16)
* Gross margin: 58.6% (up big from 54.1%)
* Full-year revenue growth now expected to hit 30% (up from 20% earlier)

The stock popped. And it should‚Äôve.

What‚Äôs driving it? AI. Lots of it.

TSMC‚Äôs HPC segment now makes up 60% of total revenue. That‚Äôs up from 52% last year. Meanwhile, smartphones are just 27% of the pie now.

The 3nm node is 24% of wafer revenue already. That‚Äôs up from 15% last quarter. Nvidia, AMD, Apple, etc. are all over it. The 5nm node is still king (36%), but 3nm is catching up fast.

Revenue from the U.S. now makes up 75% of total sales. China? Just 9%. So much for ‚Äúdependence on China.‚Äù

Earnings call had some juicy bits too:

Biggest Q&A themes were:

1. Can TSM actually keep up with all this AI demand?
2. When are AI customers moving to bleeding-edge nodes like 2nm and A16?

Management basically said: yes, fabs are ramping, we‚Äôre good. And yes, AI clients are *absolutely* moving to the newest stuff sooner due to power efficiency. These data centers eat electricity like crazy. CEO said the biggest constraint for AI players is power. A16 (coming 2026) is supposed to be 20% more efficient than 2nm, which already beats 3nm.

Also, about 30% of their future advanced node capacity will be in Arizona, not Taiwan. That‚Äôs a pretty clear signal they‚Äôre hedging geo risks.

Couple other things:

* Q3 rev guide: $31.8B to $33B.
* FX headwinds (strong NT$) hit margins a bit, but they still see 53%+ long-term gross margins.
* Capex for 2025: \~$40B.
* They called out tariffs and weak consumer markets as risks, but AI growth more than offsets that

If you  want more details on my TSM thesis, I wrote a full deep dive back in March (with way more context, valuation, risks, etc):

AMD,2025-07-20,US,"Nvidia Will Continue Controlling The AI Board Nvidia is the 'queen' of the AI ecosystem, dominating hardware, software, and systems and controlling key segments from training to inference and networking.

Unmatched AI leadership, explosive revenue growth, and strategic partnerships with players like Astera Labs, Credo, and Super Micro Computer reinforce Nvidia's central role.

China market access and the Omniverse platform provide significant new growth drivers, supporting a strong 12-24 month growth outlook and a buy rating.

Despite high absolute valuation multiples, Nvidia's rapid growth and favorable PEG ratios make it attractive versus peers; the main risk is US-China geopolitical tension.

I believe these companies are well-positioned in the AI ecosystem, but I realise that one piece is missing: the queen. Just like in a game of chess, the queen is the most powerful and versatile piece on the board. It can move in any direction (horizontal, vertical, and diagonal) and quickly cover a wide area. That is why I believe it is a perfect fit for NVIDIA (NVDA). I say this because it dominates both offensively and defensively. Just as the queen controls most of the board, NVDA controls the most valuable parts of the AI infrastructure, from training to inference, simulation, and networking. Secondly, it is versatile and critical because it spans hardware, software, and systems. This is cool because few participants can match its breadth and influence. Finally, it leverages strategic partnerships. I mean, just as the queen commands pawns, rooks, and bishops, NVDA integrates system builders (such as Super Micro Computer (SMCI)), connectivity providers (such as Credo Technology Group (CRDO) and Astera Labs (ALAB)), and government AI programmes to expand its control over the AI battlefield.

So why is the queen so special?

Well, several factors set Nvidia apart. First and foremost, it holds an unparalleled leadership position in the AI field, thanks to the combination of hardware, software, and ecosystem advantages. Its Blackwell GPU architecture makes it uniquely special. Combined with the Omniverse simulation platform, we are driving self-reinforcing AI, which is driving explosive growth. For example, in the first quarter of the 2026 fiscal year, NVDA achieved revenue of $44.1 billion, representing a year over year increase of 69%. Data centre revenue reached $39.1 billion, up 73%. Some of Nvidia's key customers such as Microsoft , Google  OpenAI, and Meta  deploy tens of thousands of Nvidia's latest GPUs each quarter. For example, according to SA Weebler Finance data, hyperscale data centre operators are running approximately 1,000 NVLink rack systems (about 72,000 GPUs) per week, with further increases expected. Ideally, this means Nvidia's data centre run rate in the AI computing sector has exceeded $170 billion annually.

Secondly, NVDA's stack is also expanding beyond GPUs. As I mentioned, its global industrial simulation platform is now being used to digitise entire factories and cities. In fact, the platform has evolved to support critical infrastructure. Original equipment manufacturers like BMW are running over 30 virtual factories on the platform to optimise production in advance. As each AI solution requires an increasing amount of synthetic training data, NVDA's end-to-end solutions form an unparalleled moat. Ideally, this platform means more users generating more simulation data, ultimately driving demand for more Nvidia computing resources. What I see is that NVDA is now at the centre of the AI value chain.

Finally, the U.S. has approved the resumption of exports of NVIDIA H20 AI GPUs to China. This means NVIDIA will be able to access China's potential market, which is significant. According to a Morgan Stanley report, China's AI market is expected to reach $1.4 trillion by 2030.

China has been systematically implementing a long-term strategy to build its domestic artificial intelligence capabilities. Its strong academic foundation, innovative methods, data, talent, and growing foreign investment are driving it toward becoming a leading artificial intelligence powerhouse...

‚Äò...China is less concerned with building the most powerful AI capabilities and more focused on bringing AI to market. China embraces open-source AI, while the United States appears to be moving toward closed, tightly controlled AI systems...‚Äô

‚Äò...The next 6 to 12 months will be a critical period for Chinese AI companies, as more and more deployments aimed at solving real-world problems begin to demonstrate productivity gains.‚Äô

Due to this milestone, NVDA's Jensen Huang estimates that NVDA's potential market size  in China will reach $50 billion. This means that China's spending on AI will increase, and Nvidia's growth prospects are expected to be stronger than ever before. I expect this growth outlook to be reflected in the upcoming quarterly earnings report to be released on 27 August 2025.

These factors combined will undoubtedly accelerate Nvidia's growth trajectory over the next 12 to 24 months. Therefore, I assign a ‚ÄòBuy‚Äô rating to Nvidia Corporation.

Nvidia's AI Ecosystem

Having highlighted the case for NVDA, I would like to connect it to some AI components I have researched previously. Some of these AI companies have remarkable growth prospects and are expected to align their growth trajectories with NVDA. Additionally, the connections between NVDA and these AI companies will help us better understand NVDA's future direction.

First, Astera Labs  is a leading connectivity chip company that recently went public in 2024. ALAB's chips support scalable and low-latency GPU rack interconnects. For more information on Astera Labs and its chips, please refer to Article 1 and Article 2. Now, Nvidia has publicly announced its collaboration with Astera on NVLink Fusion. This collaboration expands NVDA's total addressable market (TAM).

There is also Credo Technology, which is known for its active cables  re-timers, and SerDes chips. According to SA Oakoff Investments, most hyperscale computing vendors now consider CRDO's AEC to be the de facto standard for in-rack links. This means that AEC cables are the infrastructure required for NVDA's 72-GPU Blackwell rack.

Third, Super Micro Computer  and Celestica  manufacture and sell GPU racks and systems using NVDA technology. Nvidia currently provides complete data centre racks containing tens of thousands of GPUs, which are delivered to system builders like SMCI and CLS. They then collaborate with NVDA to package and sell these racks to hyperscale customers such as Microsoft, Meta, and Amazon. For more information, please refer to this article from SMCI and this article from Celestica.

In summary, these partnerships demonstrate NVIDIA's connectivity within the AI ecosystem. This confirms that NVIDIA is indeed the queen of the AI chessboard.

For a company with a market capitalisation of 4.22 trillion dollars, it still has significant growth opportunities, particularly in the Chinese market, which means there is much to watch for with NVIDIA. Additionally, I note that NVIDIA has an A- growth rating, as shown in the figure below. The company's expected revenue growth rate is 60.71%, while the industry median is 7.28%. Furthermore, its 3-5 year compound annual growth rate  for expected long-term earnings per share  growth is 29.09%, compared to the industry median of 14.29%. This clearly indicates the expected growth levels for certain potential AI opportunities, such as the Omniverse platform and the Chinese AI market.

Now, when it comes to valuation, the growth outlook is becoming clearer. First, when I look at the chart below, I notice that most metrics are above the industry median, indicating that the valuation is higher than the industry median. Its non-GAAP forward price-to-earnings ratio is 40.12 times, and its forward enterprise value to EBITDA ratio is 34.79 times, both significantly higher than the industry median. However, when I look at the non-GAAP forward price-to-earnings ratio , it indicates that the valuation is undervalued by 27%. NVDA's price-to-earnings ratio is 1.38 times, while the industry median is 1.90 times. Based on the GAAP trailing 12-month PEG, the company's P/E ratio is 0.69 times, undervalued by 31% compared to the industry median. Ideally, I would say that most multiples look high in absolute terms, but compared to NVDA's 60.71% compound annual growth rate, the stock's valuation isn't as high as it appears.

In terms of peer comparison, I chose NVDA's closest competitors because Nvidia is already far ahead in terms of market capitalisation, so I chose Broadcom and AMD. I noticed that NVDA's price-to-earnings ratio and expected price-to-earnings ratio are still lower than its peers.

I believe that the biggest risk facing NVIDIA at present is geopolitical risk. Currently, there are many uncertainties between China and the United States, especially following the imposition of tariffs on Liberation Day and the U.S. government's decision to suspend exports of H20 GPUs to China. Such situations could recur and undermine NVIDIA's growth plans and market expansion efforts. Losing the Chinese market would have a significant impact on NVIDIA's business. Additionally, geopolitical events such as trade tariffs and sanctions could affect global supply or cloud computing spending in some of the key regions where NVIDIA operates. In conclusion, in this grand AI infrastructure game, NVIDIA is the queen. Currently, it is the most powerful and flexible piece on the board. Compared to peers that may occupy other key positions, NVIDIA controls every direction. For example, AMD is the rook, SMCI is the bishop, while Credo and Astera are agile knights. Ultimately, NVIDIA determines the pace and scope of this game. As AI demand continues to grow, NVIDIA's dominant position is further strengthened by the expansion of the Chinese market. || Nvidia Will Continue Controlling The AI Board Nvidia is the 'queen' of the AI ecosystem, dominating hardware, software, and systems and controlling key segments from training to inference and networking.

Unmatched AI leadership, explosive revenue growth, and strategic partnerships with players like Astera Labs, Credo, and Super Micro Computer reinforce Nvidia's central role.

China market access and the Omniverse platform provide significant new growth drivers, supporting a strong 12-24 month growth outlook and a buy rating.

Despite high absolute valuation multiples, Nvidia's rapid growth and favorable PEG ratios make it attractive versus peers; the main risk is US-China geopolitical tension.

I believe these companies are well-positioned in the AI ecosystem, but I realise that one piece is missing: the queen. Just like in a game of chess, the queen is the most powerful and versatile piece on the board. It can move in any direction (horizontal, vertical, and diagonal) and quickly cover a wide area. That is why I believe it is a perfect fit for NVIDIA (NVDA). I say this because it dominates both offensively and defensively. Just as the queen controls most of the board, NVDA controls the most valuable parts of the AI infrastructure, from training to inference, simulation, and networking. Secondly, it is versatile and critical because it spans hardware, software, and systems. This is cool because few participants can match its breadth and influence. Finally, it leverages strategic partnerships. I mean, just as the queen commands pawns, rooks, and bishops, NVDA integrates system builders (such as Super Micro Computer (SMCI)), connectivity providers (such as Credo Technology Group (CRDO) and Astera Labs (ALAB)), and government AI programmes to expand its control over the AI battlefield.

So why is the queen so special?

Well, several factors set Nvidia apart. First and foremost, it holds an unparalleled leadership position in the AI field, thanks to the combination of hardware, software, and ecosystem advantages. Its Blackwell GPU architecture makes it uniquely special. Combined with the Omniverse simulation platform, we are driving self-reinforcing AI, which is driving explosive growth. For example, in the first quarter of the 2026 fiscal year, NVDA achieved revenue of $44.1 billion, representing a year over year increase of 69%. Data centre revenue reached $39.1 billion, up 73%. Some of Nvidia's key customers such as Microsoft , Google  OpenAI, and Meta  deploy tens of thousands of Nvidia's latest GPUs each quarter. For example, according to SA Weebler Finance data, hyperscale data centre operators are running approximately 1,000 NVLink rack systems (about 72,000 GPUs) per week, with further increases expected. Ideally, this means Nvidia's data centre run rate in the AI computing sector has exceeded $170 billion annually.

Secondly, NVDA's stack is also expanding beyond GPUs. As I mentioned, its global industrial simulation platform is now being used to digitise entire factories and cities. In fact, the platform has evolved to support critical infrastructure. Original equipment manufacturers like BMW are running over 30 virtual factories on the platform to optimise production in advance. As each AI solution requires an increasing amount of synthetic training data, NVDA's end-to-end solutions form an unparalleled moat. Ideally, this platform means more users generating more simulation data, ultimately driving demand for more Nvidia computing resources. What I see is that NVDA is now at the centre of the AI value chain.

Finally, the U.S. has approved the resumption of exports of NVIDIA H20 AI GPUs to China. This means NVIDIA will be able to access China's potential market, which is significant. According to a Morgan Stanley report, China's AI market is expected to reach $1.4 trillion by 2030.

China has been systematically implementing a long-term strategy to build its domestic artificial intelligence capabilities. Its strong academic foundation, innovative methods, data, talent, and growing foreign investment are driving it toward becoming a leading artificial intelligence powerhouse...

‚Äò...China is less concerned with building the most powerful AI capabilities and more focused on bringing AI to market. China embraces open-source AI, while the United States appears to be moving toward closed, tightly controlled AI systems...‚Äô

‚Äò...The next 6 to 12 months will be a critical period for Chinese AI companies, as more and more deployments aimed at solving real-world problems begin to demonstrate productivity gains.‚Äô

Due to this milestone, NVDA's Jensen Huang estimates that NVDA's potential market size  in China will reach $50 billion. This means that China's spending on AI will increase, and Nvidia's growth prospects are expected to be stronger than ever before. I expect this growth outlook to be reflected in the upcoming quarterly earnings report to be released on 27 August 2025.

These factors combined will undoubtedly accelerate Nvidia's growth trajectory over the next 12 to 24 months. Therefore, I assign a ‚ÄòBuy‚Äô rating to Nvidia Corporation.

Nvidia's AI Ecosystem

Having highlighted the case for NVDA, I would like to connect it to some AI components I have researched previously. Some of these AI companies have remarkable growth prospects and are expected to align their growth trajectories with NVDA. Additionally, the connections between NVDA and these AI companies will help us better understand NVDA's future direction.

First, Astera Labs  is a leading connectivity chip company that recently went public in 2024. ALAB's chips support scalable and low-latency GPU rack interconnects. For more information on Astera Labs and its chips, please refer to Article 1 and Article 2. Now, Nvidia has publicly announced its collaboration with Astera on NVLink Fusion. This collaboration expands NVDA's total addressable market (TAM).

There is also Credo Technology, which is known for its active cables  re-timers, and SerDes chips. According to SA Oakoff Investments, most hyperscale computing vendors now consider CRDO's AEC to be the de facto standard for in-rack links. This means that AEC cables are the infrastructure required for NVDA's 72-GPU Blackwell rack.

Third, Super Micro Computer  and Celestica  manufacture and sell GPU racks and systems using NVDA technology. Nvidia currently provides complete data centre racks containing tens of thousands of GPUs, which are delivered to system builders like SMCI and CLS. They then collaborate with NVDA to package and sell these racks to hyperscale customers such as Microsoft, Meta, and Amazon. For more information, please refer to this article from SMCI and this article from Celestica.

In summary, these partnerships demonstrate NVIDIA's connectivity within the AI ecosystem. This confirms that NVIDIA is indeed the queen of the AI chessboard.

For a company with a market capitalisation of 4.22 trillion dollars, it still has significant growth opportunities, particularly in the Chinese market, which means there is much to watch for with NVIDIA. Additionally, I note that NVIDIA has an A- growth rating, as shown in the figure below. The company's expected revenue growth rate is 60.71%, while the industry median is 7.28%.

This clearly indicates the expected growth levels for certain potential AI opportunities, such as the Omniverse platform and the Chinese AI market.

Now, when it comes to valuation, the growth outlook is becoming clearer. First, when I look at the chart below, I notice that most metrics are above the industry median, indicating that the valuation is higher than the industry median. Its non-GAAP forward price-to-earnings ratio is 40.12 times, and its forward enterprise value to EBITDA ratio is 34.79 times, both significantly higher than the industry median.

NVDA's price-to-earnings ratio is 1.38 times, while the industry median is 1.90 times. Based on the GAAP trailing 12-month PEG, the company's P/E ratio is 0.69 times, undervalued by 31% compared to the industry median. Ideally, I would say that most multiples look high in absolute terms, but compared to NVDA's 60.71% compound annual growth rate, the stock's valuation isn't as high as it appears.

AMD,2025-07-21,US,"AI Action Day This Wednesday I posted a couple days ago expressing my view that money can be made by being on top of trump's agenda, policy-related news, etc. I'm not saying its easy, but I think in several instances so far this year, the ""puzzle pieces"" have been out there, and if you put them together, you could have positioned ahead of the news. MP was one i mentioned in my previous post but there have been others.

To get to the point... There is an ""AI Action Day"" event happening on Wednesday. Hosted by All-In podcast people (David Sachs) and with various tech leaders in attendance as well as Trump of course.  Supposedly this will be an announcement of a larger strategy to promote US AI dominance. I would bet that there are opportunities here. Not clear if there is a home run, but I think a smart person could figure out a smart way to play this.

Unfortunately, I'm not a smart person, but maybe collectively as a group of not-smart people, we can figure out some plays here.

I can't link sources for some reason, keeps deleting my post, but you guys can google more information regarding the event if you want. TLDR It's being hosted

Technology leaders participating in the event include **Chris Power, CEO of Hadrian**; **Shyam Sankar, CTO of Palantir**; **Paul Buchheit, Partner at YCombinator; James Litinsky, CEO of MP Materials; Lisa Su, CEO of AMD.**

Additional speakers are still being confirmed.

I don't think the obvious choices are going to move much here. NVDA is already up significantly and i don't expect any announcements big enough to move a 4 trillion market cap... The easing of chip restrictions is also already priced in now. I expected this will be touched on at the event, but it's no longer news.

Spitballing but a few ideas:

I think energy will be a major focus of any strategy announcement. This is an area that is critically important for AI, and an area where the US is SIGNIFICANTLY lagging China. I'm not too sure how this could be played, but I'm considering EQT. I was looking at them last week due to the PA AI event. The stock didn't move much unfortunately, but all of nat gas seems to have struggled to close the week for whatever reason. By no means an expert here, but EQT has a major grift angle in that their CEO is closely tied to the republican party/trump.

Datacenter buildout: PWR, ACM, FLR - not really sure here. Chatgpt helped me on this one. Maybe APLD? Could be some type of policy/tax incentive to stimulate datacenter construction. not that its really needed at this point...

I'm really just spitballing and hoping to start some conversation here. || What sectors are you bullish on for the next few years? Lately stocks like NVDA, AMD and TSM have been on a strong run. Everyone seems focused on AI chips, data centers and anything related to compute power. I‚Äôm wondering what other sectors people are watching going into the next few years.

AMZN,2025-07-18,US,"MS Report: OpenAI Targets $700 Billion TAM by 2030 - Which Listed Companies Will Benefit? JP Morgan just released a lengthy report stating that OpenAI's total potential market TAM could reach $700 billion by 2030, noting that it currently has 800 million monthly activations and nearly $10 billion in annualized revenues, most of which comes from subscribers. While its GPT model leadership is being eroded by competitors, consumer-side realizations and brand strength are still seen as a moat.

Points to note:

ChatGPT generates 75% of its revenue from consumer subscriptions

GPT-4 is only 95th in LM Arena, Gemini and DeepSeek are gaining in competitiveness

Estimated timeline for profitability: circa 2029

AI Infra funding (H1 2025) reaches $63 billion

Which public market stocks stand to benefit most from OpenAI's long-term expansion? Discussion topic: Which public market stocks are best positioned to benefit from OpenAI's long-term expansion? Here are a few companies I'm currently following:

$MSFT (OpenAI's largest shareholder, Azure enabler)

$NVDA (provides training and inference power)

$AMZN / $GOOGL (competitors, also building their own base models)

$CRM / $NOW: AI verticals on the ground

Selling RIOT, MSTX which were my bitcoin exposures.

Possibly keeping TMC (which I believe in the Deep Sea mining tech). But It's hard to keep something so volatile as a deep sea mine, mining is hard enough.

Will most likely keep:  
JEPQ (I see no reason not to just hold and DCA).

F (Such a good cost basis that I think I'll just keep it as is).

MO

PFE

HRZN (A risky but good historically dividend payer. It risks lower NAV due to IPO drought which will only get worse, but it has a great basket of companies it does private financing with).

TLTW  
TMF (which are my bond exposure, not principal secured).

I have direct bond ownership as well, so I moved over all of my:  
NVDA, MSFT into direct bond ownership at 170 and 500 prices respectively.

This market is just a clown show. People said ""earnings are better now than before"" but they actually aren't. The earnings are ""better"" because of a declining dollar. Which is fine, but that's not the same as ""PE is good"".

The market is grossly over valued going into an earnings recession at best. At worst we get a massive housing crisis that crushes earnings for 30% of the US economy, and a debt crisis that crushes earnings for MSFT, NVDA, META, GOOG, AMZN, etc.

The two halves of the economy that usually plays one off the other are both staring at their own disasters.

What I will buy later.

JEPQ after QQQ corrects (whatever that looks like).  
GLD if 20% drop in gold.  
Bitcoin at $80,000 to $90,000 this cycle.  
CCJ if a 30% or greater correction.  
TMC (if I sell) if it drops to 200day.  
KO if dividend yield reaches 3.3%  
CVX (oil exposure) if I can get a 7.5%+ dividend yield.  
MO at 7%+ Div yield but not stacking right now.

In rate cuts I'll be flipping my TMF/TLTW into mostly TBT and just sell covered calls on that to keep a good cost basis until the next rate hiking cycle.","investing, stocks",6.0,229.3000030517578,225.77000427246094,225.77000427246094

My watchlist: MSFT, BGM, OPEN, AMZN, NVDA, CRM || Not all top 10 tech stocks are the same A lot is being said about the high valuations and long outperformance of the tech stocks and how risky and overvalued they are as a bunch. But there's an enormous difference just among the top 10 tech stocks by size.

TSLA is trading at a PE of 177 which doesn't make the remotest bit of sense based on the business that they are in (cars) and could be in (robotaxis, robots, and AI), even if they were wildly successful in new business areas (in which they face stiff competition) there is no way to justify the current valuation.

PLTR's PE is over 600 not much more I need to say about that.

GOOG is trading at a PE of 21. Its core search business is going to be disrupted by AI but it is still entrenched and they have the time and resources to adapt. Meanwhile they own the largest streaming platform in YouTube, and arguably the most actually successful robotaxi business in Waymo. If they were ever split up the parts would be worth far more than the sum.

AAPL's heyday is behind it since their growth is anchored in devices and they will probably never acquire significantly more market share in phones meanwhile they have to create a new Fortune 500 sized business every year just to try to keep the growth going.

AMZN on the other hand is not bound by any particular industry or market. They are getting into satellites, pharmaceutical delivery, health care, and can pick any large market they want to address.

MSFT's new leadership after the atrocious Ballmer has brought the company into huge new markets and they are well positioned to capitalize on AI, with a PE of 39 they are not cheap but by far not the most expensive with solid growth prospects.

I personally think that social media is a scourge upon the earth and is destroying the minds of young and old people alike, but META has essentially monopolies that will not be disrupted. 

Meanwhile these companies are investing nearly $300 billion in cap ex per year and have returned nearly $1 trillion to shareholders in buybacks and dividends over the past 5 years.

The company witnessed solid wireless traction and customer additions, which were partially offset by lower demand for legacy voice and data services. AT&T recorded strong subscriber growth backed by a resilient business model and robust cash flow position, driven by a diligent execution of operational plans. AT&T expects to continue investing in key areas of 5G and fiber and adjust its business according to the evolving market scenario to fuel long-term growth.

On a GAAP basis, AT&T reported a net income of $4.46 billion or 62 cents per share compared with $3.55 billion or 49 cents per share in the year-ago quarter. The significant improvement was primarily attributable to higher contributions from the DIRECTV investments during the quarter.

This will allow us to select exactly the stocks that will change the most when new tariff changes are announced, or buy the ones that are least sensitive to hedge your position or profit from the opposite direction.

To calculate the sensitivity of stocks to this news, I first looked at which trading days the returns of the S&P 500 were dominated by tariff announcements. I used [this New York Times article](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/13/business/economy/trump-tariff-timeline.html) to find the days on which important announcements were made. If the news was on a non-trading day, I then assumed the next trading day was impacted by the news.

I then regressed the daily returns of each stock in the S&P 500 on the S&P 500 itself (to calculate the market beta), and on a vector that contains the returns of the S&P 500 when there are important tariff announcements, and 0 otherwise (to calculate the beta to tariff news). I used daily returns since the start of 2025.

How should you interpret these results?

Well, for example, if on August 1 Trump announces something that makes the S&P 500 shoot up, then APA Corporation is expected to shoot up by 0.83 (beta to market) + 1.32 (beta to tariffs) = 2.15 that amount! So if the S&P 500 goes up by 5%, APA Corporation is expected to go up by 10.75%! This also works the other way around: if news comes out that makes the market go down, the companies *sensitive* to this news will go down more.

The companies that are least sensitive are expected to go the other way. For example, if the S&P 500 goes *down* by 1% because of new tariff changes, Molina Healthcare is expected to move by 0.75% - 0.85% = -0.10% in the other direction. Hence, it will actually go up slightly!

In other words, when tariff news is released, the *sensitive* stocks co-move with the market (no matter if up or down), the *insensitive* stocks barely move, or move opposite to the market.

Use this to your advantage!

How should you interpret these results?

Well, for example, if on August 1 Trump announces something that makes the S&P 500 shoot up, then APA Corporation is expected to shoot up by 0.83 (beta to market) + 1.32 (beta to tariffs) = 2.15 that amount! So if the S&P 500 goes up by 5%, APA Corporation is expected to go up by 10.75%! This also works the other way around: if news comes out that makes the market go down, the companies *sensitive* to this news will go down more.

The companies that are least sensitive are expected to go the other way. For example, if the S&P 500 goes *down* by 1% because of new tariff changes, Molina Healthcare is expected to move by 0.75% - 0.85% = -0.10% in the other direction. Hence, it will actually go up slightly!

In other words, when tariff news is released, the *sensitive* stocks co-move with the market (no matter if up or down), the *insensitive* stocks barely move, or move opposite to the market.

Use this to your advantage!

I can share the code and data with those that are interested, let me know. || I calculated which stocks are most sensitive to tariff news In preparation for the August 1 tariff deadlines, I think it's important to know which stocks are most and least sensitive to tariff-related news. This will allow us to select exactly the stocks that will change the most when new tariff changes are announced, or buy the ones that are least sensitive to hedge your position or profit from the opposite direction.

To calculate the sensitivity of stocks to this news, I first looked at which trading days the returns of the S&P 500 were dominated by tariff announcements. I used [this New York Times article](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/13/business/economy/trump-tariff-timeline.html) to find the days on which important announcements were made. If the news was on a non-trading day, I then assumed the next trading day was impacted by the news.

I then regressed the daily returns of each stock in the S&P 500 on the S&P 500 itself (to calculate the market beta), and on a vector that contains the returns of the S&P 500 when there are important tariff announcements, and 0 otherwise (to calculate the beta to tariff news). I used daily returns since the start of 2025.

I find that these stocks are the 10 stocks *most* sensitive to tariff news:

The move marks an early step toward modernizing the infrastructure that underpins most of the financial ecosystem. If adopted broadly, it could make it easier and faster for institutional investors to use these assets as collateral and reduce trade settlement times.
BlackRock (BLK.N), opens new tab, BNY Investments Dreyfus, Federated Hermes, Fidelity Investments and Goldman Sachs Asset Management are among the companies participating in the initial rollout.


Goldman Sachs (GS.N), opens new tab and BNY (BK.N), opens new tab have joined hands to launch digital tokens that mirror shares of money market funds, deepening Wall Street's push to bring blockchain technology into traditional finance.
Investors can now buy and sell money market fund shares on BNY's LiquidityDirect platform, with a digital record of those shares created on Goldman's blockchain system, the two financial giants said on Wednesday.


Other asset managers are also exploring tokenization. In January, Apollo (APO.N), opens new tabpartnered with, opens new tab Securitize to launch a feeder fund that would channel capital from crypto-native investors into its global credit fund.
GAINING TRACTION
While it is still a subject of debate, tokenization's potential to drastically reshape the investing landscape has drawn strong interest.
It is being touted as the next breakthrough for bridging the gap between traditional and digital finance, with supporters saying it could open up an asset class that has long been out of reach for retail investors.


""We're at the precipice of doing something very special, and that's really the democratization of markets,"" said Chris Perkins, president of crypto investment firm CoinFund.
The growing interest in tokenization coincides with the renewed optimism in the crypto industry, which has rallied in recent months and gained momentum after the Genius Act was passed earlier this month.
Critics, however, say tokenization could allow companies to bypass the guardrails put in place to protect retail investors.


Companies may also not consent to having their securities tokenized. Earlier this month, OpenAI objected to Robinhood's (HOOD.O), opens new tab tokens tied to its private shares.",stocks,1.0,151.85000610351562,150.9528590611049,150.9528590611049

It seems to me that crypto could be considered in the 'stock' category (yes, even though it's not a stock) in terms of risk/returns? This is why we have allocations after-all, the risk/return considerations.

What about other asset classes like, gold, or crypto? 70/30 leaves, technically, 0% for commodities.

Thanks || $110K on RKT Calls Now.  Can‚Äôt Stop, Won‚Äôt Stop After having initiated a $61K position yesterday and posting about it, I saw the following headline and immediately upped my position to $110K:

TACO:  WE ARE THINKING ABOUT NO TAXES ON CAPITAL GAINS ON HOUSES

If this indeed comes to pass, RKT easily doubles in value as every business segment in their housing ecosystem should blow earnings estimates out of the water for the rest of TACO‚Äôs term in office.

This is the best risk-adjusted play in the housing sector right now in my opinion.  Sharp shops like ValueAct and Citron clearly agree.

Position: Scaling into 1,000+ shares 
Conviction: Stronger than the LT4 torque curve
Catalyst: IP dominance in AI memory infrastructure nobody‚Äôs pricing in

üèéÔ∏è The Setup:

I sold my 2019 Sebring Orange Z06 ‚Äî 2LZ, Kalahari interior, 5,955 miles of pure sauce ‚Äî for $78K cash.

Why?

Because while everyone‚Äôs chasing gains in NVDA, AMD, and MU, I went full galaxy brain and bought the company that quietly gets paid every time those companies scale.

I didn‚Äôt just trade torque for tech.
I traded a car for compoundable alpha.



üß† What is Rambus (RMBS)?
	‚Ä¢	NOT a RAM company, it‚Äôs the patent-powered IP tollbooth for AI memory.
	‚Ä¢	Their tech fuels DDR5, HBM3, PCIe, and CXL ‚Äî aka every AI/data center ramp in progress.
	‚Ä¢	Licensing model = 80% gross margins, no debt, $500M cash, printing risk-free cash every quarter.
	‚Ä¢	No manufacturing risk, just collecting checks like a chip landlord.



üî• Technical Breakout Confirmed
	‚Ä¢	Cleared a cup-with-handle base at $63.15, broke out hard and is now pushing toward ATHs near $69‚Äì70.
	‚Ä¢	Riding above 21- and 50-day moving averages like it‚Äôs on magnetic rails.
	‚Ä¢	Relative Strength: 87
	‚Ä¢	IBD Composite Rating: 96
	‚Ä¢	EPS Rating: 99

üìâ Every technical signal says:
This thing wants to fly.

üíº Who‚Äôs Buying?

Institutions are already ahead of you:

Fund	Value Held	     Trend
BlackRock	$1.18B	      ‚Üë Increasing
Vanguard	$644M	‚Üë Increasing
T. Rowe Price	$453M	‚Üë Increasing
Invesco	$234M	       ‚Üë Increasing
Janus, Mariner, Signaturefd	+$113M in July	Just entered

Even IBD just lumped RMBS in with NVDA and AVGO on their elite ‚Äúfunds are loading‚Äù list. This ain‚Äôt some rando tech penny ‚Äî this is the next chapter of AI infrastructure.



üìÜ What‚Äôs Next?
	1.	Q2 Earnings ‚Äì July 28
	‚Ä¢	Expected: $0.58 EPS / $167M revenue
	‚Ä¢	Rambus always sandbags. Beat + raise incoming.
	2.	AI build-out tailwind
	‚Ä¢	DDR5, HBM3, CXL adoption means licensing revenue spikes.
	‚Ä¢	They‚Äôre in every next-gen memory and PCIe lane that matters.
	3.	Price Targets
	‚Ä¢	Analyst Median: $71
	‚Ä¢	Top End: $90+
	‚Ä¢	My PT: 3-digit club.
Because IP + AI = asymmetry.



üöÄ Why I‚Äôm All-In:
	‚Ä¢	Most traders buy what CNBC tells them. I buy what CNBC will eventually discover.
	‚Ä¢	NVDA gets headlines. RMBS gets checks.
	‚Ä¢	I‚Äôm not swinging for a 10% gain. I‚Äôm leveraging intellectual property in a vertical that can‚Äôt function without it.

You can keep your car. I‚Äôll take the cash flow.

BK,2025-07-22,US,"[DD] The Value Play Cycle Needs Its Third: Why I'm Betting on DNUT Alright degenerates, we need to talk. OPEN ripped. KSS followed. But these cycles always come in threes, and we're missing the final piece.

**""History doesn't repeat but it does rhyme""** \- so what's the next verse?

I think it's DNUT. But if you've got a better idea, drop it in the comments. Here's my case:

# The Setup: OPEN your ahole and KSS DNUTz

Yeah, I went there. But while everyone's drunk on the first two gains, there's a $560M market cap company trading at bankruptcy multiples despite growing revenue.

**Current Price: $3.58**  
**Market Cap: $560M**  
**My Target: $8-12**

Show me another 2-3x opportunity this obvious.

# The Valuation Gap Is Insane

Look at these multiples and tell me this makes sense:

|Company|EV/EBITDA|EV/Sales|Context|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|**DNUT**|**9.2x**|**1.2x**|Priced for bankruptcy despite growth|
|Starbucks|18.9x|3.57x|Premium coffee valuation|
|Restaurant Brands|17.0x|\~5x|Tim Hortons/BK parent|
|Dunkin' (2020 sale)|**23x**|N/A|What buyers actually pay for donuts|

Yet DNUT is:

* Operating **17,982 points of access globally**
* Posted 5% organic growth in FY2024
* Has one of the most recognized brands in food

Find me another company this disconnected from fundamentals.

# The Bear Cases Are All Weak

**""Ozempic will kill fast food""** \- I'm a fatass myself and there's no amount of Ozempic that removes my craving for hot, fresh donuts at 2am. Look at MCD and CMG at ATHs. People on Ozempic eat less, not never. A glazed donut is 190 calories of pure dopamine - that demand isn't disappearing.

**""The McDonald's deal ended!""** \- No, the TEST ended after rolling out to 2,400 stores. You think McDonald's spent millions on infrastructure for a 3-month trial? They're analyzing data. If it worked (spoiler: donuts + coffee = money), this goes nationwide.

**""They suspended the dividend!""** \- Good. They're investing in growth instead of paying boomers. That's exactly what you want in a turnaround.

# Three Ways This Plays Out

**Starting Point:**

* Stock: $3.58
* Market Cap: $560M
* Growing business with fixable issues

**Scenario 1: Modest Re-rate (12x EBITDA)**

Still way below peers:

* **Target: $8-9**
* **Return: 125-150%**

**Scenario 2: Industry Average (15x)**

If operations improve:

* **Target: $11-13**
* **Return: 200-250%**

**Scenario 3: Nothing Changes (10x)**

Status quo maintained:

* **Target: $5-6**
* **Return: 40-70%**

Even the bear case would be a healthy return on your money. Show me better risk/reward.

# Why The Setup Is Perfect

‚úì **Meme-able ticker** (DNUT - come on)  
‚úì **Small cap** ($560M = moves fast)  
‚úì **Value play** (half peer multiples)  
‚úì **Real business** (17,982 locations)  
‚úì **Catalyst rich** (McDonald's decision pending)  
‚úì **Acquisition target** (at these multiples) ‚úì **Options flow confirming** (Huge call buying at $5 strike)

# Recent ""Problems"" Are Actually Bullish

* **Q1 revenue down 1%** ‚Üí They sold Insomnia Cookies (portfolio cleanup)
* **Dividend suspended** ‚Üí More cash for growth/turnaround
* **McDonald's test ""ended""** ‚Üí Infrastructure built, awaiting expansion
* **Debt concerns** ‚Üí Manageable at 5x EBITDA, becomes nothing if margins improve

Every QSR turnaround story looks exactly like this before the re-rate.

# But Here's Where I Need Your Input

I'm convinced DNUT is the third play because:

1. **Valuation** \- It's the most undervalued name I can find
2. **Size** \- Small enough to move like OPEN and KSS did
3. **Catalysts** \- McDonald's decision, margin improvements, M&A potential
4. **Meme factor** \- The ticker alone guarantees viral potential
5. **Options flow** \- Big money is already positioning

But maybe I'm missing something. What else fits the pattern?

* Under $1B market cap?
* Trading at distressed multiples?
* Has clear catalysts ahead?
* Meme-able enough for WSB?
* Seeing unusual options activity?

Drop your picks below. But until someone shows me better risk/reward than 7:1 upside, I'm loading DNUT.

# Someone's Already Loading - Check the Options Flow

Here's what really got my attention: MASSIVE call buying the past few days, absolutely exploding today. The $5 strikes are getting hammered with volume.

Someone with deep pockets is betting big on a move above $5. That's a 40% move from here, and they're paying premium for it. When smart money moves this aggressively on a small cap, you pay attention.

This isn't retail buying weeklies. This is institutional-sized flow betting on a re-rate.

[past week](https://preview.redd.it/xcxfleepngef1.png?width=2142&format=png&auto=webp&s=b69b385edf49636702af95a44e47b6c3d3038751)

[today](https://preview.redd.it/1od3hcy7qgef1.png?width=2150&format=png&auto=webp&s=0af667fdfc86245bc643c1a068a79688b06447dd)

# The Play

The options market is telling you something. When you see this kind of call buying on a beaten-down small cap with clear catalysts, it usually means someone knows something.

Those $5 calls? If DNUT hits just the LOW end of fair value ($8), those are 10-15x. If it hits $12? Those calls print harder than JPow in 2020.

I like the 11/21 $5 call. IV is only at 87% and volume is sufficient at 2k+

https://preview.redd.it/9lghn7dwqgef1.png?width=1858&format=png&auto=webp&s=6e3f654e56abef9da84cf86b0b6c83fa3e7757b2

**My Position:**

https://preview.redd.it/s2v1a859sgef1.png?width=1900&format=png&auto=webp&s=1c006ba69e418e6820ad3344bd8773fd44756bc9

The first two already ran. Don't be late to the third.

Because when McDonald's announces the national rollout, when margins tick up even 100bps, when some PE firm offers 15x EBITDA - this thing gaps to $8+ overnight.

Every distressed QSR (finance bro speak for fast food) that fixed itself got bought:

* Dunkin': 23x EBITDA to Inspire Brands
* Panera: Bought by JAB
* Popeyes: Acquired by RBI
* Buffalo Wild Wings: Taken private by Roark

At current multiples, DNUT is a sitting duck.

The cycle comes in threes:  
OPEN ‚úì  
KSS ‚úì  
???

I say DNUT. The options flow says DNUT. Prove us wrong.

Edit: position update as of 7/23 12:22am (since I keep getting asked for it). I didn't dump on you. Also, as a warning: DO NOT buy afterhours. That shit is too low volume. Just wait til the morning and get a better price

Most battery tech journalism is frustrating because you will hear constant tales of a tech that will double or triple battery capacity, and then of course the change never happens. The reason for this is multi-faceted:

1) what works in a lab often doesn't work in real world conditions,
2) battery materials are like two faced super-models they can be absolutely perfect when looking at one metric, but can have debilitating shortcomings when looking at another, and

3) most of the time you need to see 100 different success stories in parallel to make a dramatic change happen, and the article speaks of the 1 improvement only and speaks as if the other 99 problems have already been solved.

If you're going to see a new type of battery that has the potential not to just dominate current markets, but to create entirely new markets for electrification; a convergence of multiple incredibly difficult to master technologies would need to happen in parallel. And there would need to be enabling tech that would allow each subcomponent to cover the flaws of the other so that in the aggregate you have a well-rounded battery that can dominate.

This type of battery is still a dream, anything more than a whisper and it can vanish. But for those of you who dare to dream with me, let me whisper away and explain what I might be seeing in the industry and how Enovix might play the crucial role in bringing it all together‚Ä¶

*Not financial advice, but if I were giving financial advice, I would advise you to assess ENVX based on the AI-1 battery and your assumptions as to market share, manufacturing, and margins that it can take in the  Consumer electronics space in the coming years.

So what type of potential battery am I talking about? A solid-state (sulfide based), sulfur cathode battery, with a pre-lithiated si anode. This type of battery would be sourced from cheap, scalable, and abundant materials with an energy density that could potentially enable regional flight or trans-pacific cargo shipping. But every step in that chain has immense hurdles to overcome before you can  get there. Let's evaluate the potential and the hurdles one by one, and let's see how it fits into the Enovix tech stack.

Let's start first with our baby, Enovix. I won't go deep into the details because my followers already know the story well. Enovix is not a Si battery company, it's a novel battery architecture, that has properties that enable it to use non-traditional battery materials. One such property is its ability to handle electrodes that swell. Electrodes that swell are the best kind, they swell because they are storing so much lithium they form a new alloy and balloon up in size. Intercalating (traditional) battery materials on the other hand can only store a little bit of lithium because they store the lithium between layers, like a bookshelf holding books.

So if you can build a battery mechanically designed to handle swelling, you've invented a new class of batteries. You've invented conversion class batteries.

But how does Enovix do this? Through a very simple trick in physics. Force=Pressure*Area. Enovix laser dices its electrodes and then stands them on their thin edge and stacks those thin edge standing electrodes for the width of their cell. What that has done is re-oriented the large face of the electrodes to the sides of the battery and not to the top of the battery. If using conversion style electrodes that swell, the larger part of the elctrodes are facing the small face of the battery (the side)  and not the large one. So again, F=P*A and what you've just done is dramatically reduced the A in the equation. That means you can dramatically reduce the F required in the equation to achieve a P that can constrain the urge to swell. Indeed, because of the orthogonal stacking, Enovix can easily add 10 Megapascals of stack pressure to the solid electrodes (the liquid electrolyte is under normal pressure) with a tiny constraint system. Typical prismatic cells have stack pressure around 0.1 Mpa maybe to up to 1 Mpa.

And then as a bonus, the shape of these electrodes stood on their thin edge provides easy access to pre-lithiate si anodes.

And then as an even better bonus the orientation just happens to be perfectly shaped like a heat exchanger. Having all of these strips of electrodes oriented this way allows uniform and very close access to cooling. We're talking 33x more efficient cooling. You can get the heat out of the center of the cell uniformly with ease.

There are other advantages, but for the rest of this discussion, Enovix's ability to provide stack pressure and its ability to provide extreme thermal control are going to be the two properties of the architecture that enable the rest of the magic I will soon discuss.


The next element of that super battery I need to discuss is the solid state element. ""Solid state is the holy grail of battery development"" is a common refrain. That's mostly marketing (inside joke for me), but solid state does have some extreme advantages.

Upsides:
1) Imagine picking up two bags of sand. One is wet and one is dry. Which one is lighter? A lot lighter

2) Because the electrolyte layer IS the separator, you get rid of the inactive separator. You also get rid of other inactive components that don't need to be there if there is no liquid electrolyte.

3) Often conflated with solid state tech is actually just anode side improvements. Solid state often works better with pure lithium metal on the anode side than can be done with liquid electrolytes; in a liquid electrolyte you have a more unstable SEI layer and in solid state you can have a stronger anode electrolyte      interface which can enable pure lithium metal anodes. That translates to serious gains for the whole system similar to what enovix sees by making massive anode side improvements using si. *I'm still skeptical on lithium metal working in the real world. It always will work in the lab, but lithium metal exists nowhere in nature as li metal because its too reactive.

4) No flammable electrolyte reduces fire hazard.

Downsides:
A battery is just a reversible chemistry reaction where negative electrons (electricity) flow in and out and positive ions (lithium in this case) flow back and forth between two electrodes. The flow of those positive ions is easier to facilitate in a liquid vs in a solid. But serious progress has been made using solids.

Ionic conductivity: this is the challenge of moving positive ions around. Surprisingly, sulfide based      electrolyte layers are getting so good that their Siemens per centimeter (how much resistance to moving ions) is approaching that and sometimes      exceeding liquid electrolytes. Quite frankly, this is miracle number 1 in the whole chain. The better the ionic conductivity, the thinner the electrolyte gets to be and just like regular separators thinner is better both for volume and for weight and for cost. Sulfide solid state has a clear advantage over oxide/ceramic based ones that have to be thicker both for ionic conductivity reasons and for brittleness reasons.

Interfacial Connection: think  of a relay race. The ionic conductivity is how fast the runners can run but the interface between the cathode->solid electrolyte->anode is like the baton exchange in a relay race. This is where SSB's tend to struggle. But it turns out, with sulfide based electrolyte layers high stack pressure can greatly improve the interfacial connection allowing for  a uniform and seamless connection between the layers of battery. (*hint, Enovix architecture easily provides stack pressure).

Hot spots and heat transfer issues. The liquid electrolyte doesn't just transfer the ions effectively,      it also transfer heat around the cell, bringing it to the edge of the cell where it can cooled. Without that liquid electrolyte, even though its less flammable, those hot spots will kill cycle life and cause degradation issues if not dealt with. *If only there were a perfect architecture for thermal control.

Dendrites in a lithium metal anode. Sulfide based SSB are considered more prone to dendrites than oxide      based SSB's. This is likely why NIO, makes their semi-solid state battery based on a sulfide layer with a prelithiated Si-C mix on the anode side rather than the lithium metal side. (I wonder who else can do that anode side trick‚Ä¶.but at a much higher % of Si-C?)

Moisture sensitivity: sulfides are extremely sensitive to moisture and current manufacturers like Toyota have worked to use additives and coatings that make it less      so.

Manufacturability: Can you make the electrolyte? Once you've made that, can you then use it when      manufacturing the cell itself? Sulfide based electrolytes are extremely sensitive to moisture and oxygen, and using them to make a cell would likely require at least some of the steps to be done in a pure argon or a pure nitrogen environment, which means lights off automation would be required for those steps.

I don't want to understate the challenge here. Being able to allow ion transfer in a solid electrolyte is incredibly challenging to make happen in a cell, and incredibly difficult to manufacture in a scalable process. But there are at least two companies (Nio and Cherry) already taking this trick to production ready cells in China, and companies like Toyota/Samsung/Solid Power all have made incredible progress. Sulfide based SSB's are clearly stepping out of the proof of concept stage and starting to be ready for the next level. If you add in an architecture that easily adds stack pressure and thermal control, you might be on to something‚Ä¶

$ENVX

We've now made it to the cathode side of this super battery equation. Sulfur based cathodes. Unlike every single other battery cathode on the marketplace today that is intercalating, sulfur is a conversion style cathode. That means it forms an alloy with the lithium and can store much Much MUCH more lithium than anything else on the market. It's also incredibly abundant, cheap, and light.

So why the hell are you just hearing about it now? Did an anon on Twitter discover this wonder battery material under everyone's nose? Of course not. Sulfur is the definition of the two-faced supermodel. It's amazing in some respects, and atrocious in other respects. If you can find a way to cover its weaknesses, you have a potential super battery.

What are those weaknesses? First and foremost you have serious cycle life issues resulting from ""polysulfide shuttling."" Lithium sulfur undergoes multiple reactions when it takes in and then releases lithium and in this process tiny ""polysulfides"" can escape to the anode side and this absolutely wrecks any hope of cycle life you had with the battery. Current lithium sulfur cathode makers are trying to mitigate this by using various carbon products to trap the polysulfides before they shuttle away.

But it turns out there is a much more effective way to contain the number 1 problem of polysulfide shuttling. The solution is to pair sulfur based cathodes with sulfide based solid state electrolytes. This 100% filters out any polysulfides shutting all the way to the anode. 100%. Now there likely still is some impact from cathode side only polysulfide shuttling, but we're talking 95% of the problem is solved for you if you can pair sulfur cathode with sulfide electrolyte.

So once again, did I, an anon on twitter just discover this amazing trick that has eluded battery chemists for decades? Of course not. As a conversion style cathode, Sulfur expands and contracts by up to 80% of its volume in charge and discharge. This means that the number one unsolved problem for SSB's, that of interfacial contact between the layers, becomes virtually impossible to do with sulfur based cathodes making the point moot. 

But what if you have a battery architecture that can easily add in extremely high stack pressure in such a way that the expansion is controlled. The interface between the particles even in a sulfur cathode are perfectly uniform and perfectly in contact with a sulfide based electrolyte? That's exactly what Enovix can do. 

But sulfur's amazing potential isn't purely held back by polysulfide shuttling. It also is known for very low power output. We're talking 0.1 C power output (weak sauce), when the batteries required for drones are going to need to be on the order of 10C. This is where the work of the cathode manufacturers pairing it with new types of easily made carbon are making massive amounts of progress. Multiple companies and universities are now testing lithium sulfur based cathodes that are both high capacity and high power now, unheard of only a few years ago.

The next downside to sulfur unfortunately is volumetric density. Gravimetrically it is untouchable. Volumetrically it is weak. Cathode makers have to use low sulfur loading to increase its power output and also a lot of binder to glue it together during its expansion and contraction. In addition, they try to space it out pretty far apart to allow for said expansion and contraction. Once again, the Enovix high stack pressure can make a dramatic difference here. It can greatly reduce the amount of binder required, and the mechanical system is designed for the stuff to be packed in tight, because it is a conversion class battery designed to handle the swell.

The final problem I will discuss is one of heat. All Enovix investors know, the secret to extreme fast charge is rapid and uniform heat extraction from the center of the cell during charging. Fast charge brings in a ton of resistive heating related to bringing all that power in at once. But lesser known, is the fact that most intercalating cathode materials have a slightly endothermic reaction when the cathode gives up the lithium during charging. This means the chemical reaction that occurs during charging of say an LCO cathode, actually reduces the heat in the cell not adds to it. But sulfur is different. When it gives up the lithium, that multi stage reaction is exothermic at every stage. Meaning, if you want to fast charge you now have to get the resistive heat (resistive heat is why a toaster gets hot) out as well as the heat from the chemical reaction itself. And to add pain to this equation, if you're doing all of this in a solid state battery, you don't have a liquid that can rapidly transfer the heat from the center of the cell to the edge. If you don't have a battery form factor/architecture specifically designed for rapid heat extraction, you are going to create hotspots that kill the cycle life of your battery.

Hopefully now you are starting to see why having a battery that can provide high stack pressure and extreme thermal control is not just a nice to have, but is absolutely crucial to making this type of battery work.

$ENVX

We're now to the anode side. I won't belabor this point because everyone knows this is already where Enovix shines. It takes 100% Si-C, prelithiates it, and then uses that anode side advantage in conjunction with regular LCO on the cathode to create the AI-1 battery that is about to take the high margin consumer electronics space by storm.

I will reiterate, that the knock on sulfide based solid state electrolyte is that it is more prone to dendrite formation when compared with oxide based SSB. So while sulfides are basically twice as ionically conductive allowing it to be much thinner (both lighter and more volumetrically dense), it may not be as reliable when using lithium metal. Well, the very easy solution to this is to use si on the anode side, especially if you're partnering with a si anode expert.

BTW, NIO currently makes semi-solid state batteries (using traditional cathode materials and retaining half the liquid weight because its only semi solid state), and they use si on the anode side presumably for this exact reason. In real world conditions, the only route to get to extremely high cycle life for this type of battery is si on the anode side not li metal imho.

$ENVX

Let me summarize. There is a whisper of a dream for a potential battery that would not just be an upgrade to existing batteries, it would be a world changing technology that future historians would list alongside the invention of the steam engine. But in order to achieve this multiple miracles from an entire ecosystem of companies and universities would have to happen in parallel and the subcomponents all have to work in concert to hide each other's weaknesses.

But, in theory.....

1) The main weakness of the  sulfur based cathode (polysulfide shuttling) can be solved by using a      sulfide based SSB

2) The main weakness of a SSB, especially when paired with an expanding and contracting sulfur based      cathode (interfacial connectivity), can be solved by high stack pressure easily achieved using Enovix architecture.

3) The second main weakness for sulfur based cathodes of volumetric density, can be dramatically improved by the high stack pressure easily achieved using Enovix Architecture.

4) The serious problem of dendrite formation from a sulfide based SSB can be solved using pre lithiated si on the anode side rather than li metal, a technique Enovix has already perfected.

5) The serious problems regarding heat extraction and thermal control that would come from a sulfur based cathode having exothermic reactions during charging, and made  worse by an all solid battery without the liquid electrolyte to transfer heat around, would have to be solved by a battery architecture that      specifically enables rapid and uniform heat extraction.

All of this would have to be manufactured by teams of experts capable of manufacturing in extreme      environments. Microchip manufacturers do that every day.

Other problems like power output for sulfur based cathodes or ionic conductivity for sulfide based solid electrolytes are immensely challenging, but appear to be being solved by multiple companies as we speak. Enovix potentially can serve as the architecture and partner that enables it all. 

Now the beauty of this whole thing is, it's not a zero to 1 proposition for Enovix. As we speak, Enovix is about to capitalize on being able to produce batteries with JUST the anode side of this equation. The AI-1 battery that is north of 900 Wh/L, has a 3C charge rate, high cycle life, and AI enabling power output is the result of only one side of this equation paired with an LCO cathode. And after that, if they're challenged they'll implement a higher voltage cathode (likely specially coated LCO) to continue their dominance. But in the background, they can be working on bringing together the next gen battery ecosystem required to make this much bigger dream happen. Maybe the next step is just the SSB side. And then the final step would be the sulfur cathode paired with it all. This is all wildly speculative, but extremely exciting. It should at least be known that these potential tech tree combinations appear to be coming together.

Most battery tech journalism is frustrating because you will hear constant tales of a tech that will double or triple battery capacity, and then of course the change never happens. The reason for this is multi-faceted:

1) what works in a lab often doesn't work in real world conditions,
2) battery materials are like two faced super-models they can be absolutely perfect when looking at one metric, but can have debilitating shortcomings when looking at another, and

3) most of the time you need to see 100 different success stories in parallel to make a dramatic change happen, and the article speaks of the 1 improvement only and speaks as if the other 99 problems have already been solved.

If you're going to see a new type of battery that has the potential not to just dominate current markets, but to create entirely new markets for electrification; a convergence of multiple incredibly difficult to master technologies would need to happen in parallel. And there would need to be enabling tech that would allow each subcomponent to cover the flaws of the other so that in the aggregate you have a well-rounded battery that can dominate.

This type of battery is still a dream, anything more than a whisper and it can vanish. But for those of you who dare to dream with me, let me whisper away and explain what I might be seeing in the industry and how Enovix might play the crucial role in bringing it all together‚Ä¶

*Not financial advice, but if I were giving financial advice, I would advise you to assess ENVX based on the AI-1 battery and your assumptions as to market share, manufacturing, and margins that it can take in the  Consumer electronics space in the coming years.

So what type of potential battery am I talking about? A solid-state (sulfide based), sulfur cathode battery, with a pre-lithiated si anode.

3) most of the time you need to see 100 different success stories in parallel to make a dramatic change happen, and the article speaks of the 1 improvement only and speaks as if the other 99 problems have already been solved.

If you're going to see a new type of battery that has the potential not to just dominate current markets, but to create entirely new markets for electrification; a convergence of multiple incredibly difficult to master technologies would need to happen in parallel. And there would need to be enabling tech that would allow each subcomponent to cover the flaws of the other so that in the aggregate you have a well-rounded battery that can dominate.

This type of battery is still a dream, anything more than a whisper and it can vanish. But for those of you who dare to dream with me, let me whisper away and explain what I might be seeing in the industry and how Enovix might play the crucial role in bringing it all together‚Ä¶

*Not financial advice, but if I were giving financial advice, I would advise you to assess ENVX based on the AI-1 battery and your assumptions as to market share, manufacturing, and margins that it can take in the  Consumer electronics space in the coming years.

So what type of potential battery am I talking about? A solid-state (sulfide based), sulfur cathode battery, with a pre-lithiated si anode. This type of battery would be sourced from cheap, scalable, and abundant materials with an energy density that could potentially enable regional flight or trans-pacific cargo shipping. But every step in that chain has immense hurdles to overcome before you can  get there. Let's evaluate the potential and the hurdles one by one, and let's see how it fits into the Enovix tech stack.

Let's start first with our baby, Enovix. I won't go deep into the details because my followers already know the story well. Enovix is not a Si battery company, it's a novel battery architecture, that has properties that enable it to use non-traditional battery materials. One such property is its ability to handle electrodes that swell. Electrodes that swell are the best kind, they swell because they are storing so much lithium they form a new alloy and balloon up in size. Intercalating (traditional) battery materials on the other hand can only store a little bit of lithium because they store the lithium between layers, like a bookshelf holding books.

So if you can build a battery mechanically designed to handle swelling, you've invented a new class of batteries. You've invented conversion class batteries.

But how does Enovix do this? Through a very simple trick in physics. Force=Pressure*Area. Enovix laser dices its electrodes and then stands them on their thin edge and stacks those thin edge standing electrodes for the width of their cell. What that has done is re-oriented the large face of the electrodes to the sides of the battery and not to the top of the battery. If using conversion style electrodes that swell, the larger part of the elctrodes are facing the small face of the battery (the side)  and not the large one. So again, F=P*A and what you've just done is dramatically reduced the A in the equation. That means you can dramatically reduce the F required in the equation to achieve a P that can constrain the urge to swell. Indeed, because of the orthogonal stacking, Enovix can easily add 10 Megapascals of stack pressure to the solid electrodes (the liquid electrolyte is under normal pressure) with a tiny constraint system. Typical prismatic cells have stack pressure around 0.1 Mpa maybe to up to 1 Mpa.

And then as a bonus, the shape of these electrodes stood on their thin edge provides easy access to pre-lithiate si anodes.

And then as an even better bonus the orientation just happens to be perfectly shaped like a heat exchanger. Having all of these strips of electrodes oriented this way allows uniform and very close access to cooling. We're talking 33x more efficient cooling. You can get the heat out of the center of the cell uniformly with ease.

There are other advantages, but for the rest of this discussion, Enovix's ability to provide stack pressure and its ability to provide extreme thermal control are going to be the two properties of the architecture that enable the rest of the magic I will soon discuss.


The next element of that super battery I need to discuss is the solid state element. ""Solid state is the holy grail of battery development"" is a common refrain. That's mostly marketing (inside joke for me), but solid state does have some extreme advantages.

Upsides:
1) Imagine picking up two bags of sand. One is wet and one is dry. Which one is lighter? A lot lighter

2) Because the electrolyte layer IS the separator, you get rid of the inactive separator. You also get rid of other inactive components that don't need to be there if there is no liquid electrolyte.

3) Often conflated with solid state tech is actually just anode side improvements. Solid state often works better with pure lithium metal on the anode side than can be done with liquid electrolytes; in a liquid electrolyte you have a more unstable SEI layer and in solid state you can have a stronger anode electrolyte      interface which can enable pure lithium metal anodes. That translates to serious gains for the whole system similar to what enovix sees by making massive anode side improvements using si. *I'm still skeptical on lithium metal working in the real world. It always will work in the lab, but lithium metal exists nowhere in nature as li metal because its too reactive.

4) No flammable electrolyte reduces fire hazard.

Downsides:
A battery is just a reversible chemistry reaction where negative electrons (electricity) flow in and out and positive ions (lithium in this case) flow back and forth between two electrodes. The flow of those positive ions is easier to facilitate in a liquid vs in a solid. But serious progress has been made using solids.

Ionic conductivity: this is the challenge of moving positive ions around. Surprisingly, sulfide based      electrolyte layers are getting so good that their Siemens per centimeter (how much resistance to moving ions) is approaching that and sometimes      exceeding liquid electrolytes. Quite frankly, this is miracle number 1 in the whole chain. The better the ionic conductivity, the thinner the electrolyte gets to be and just like regular separators thinner is better both for volume and for weight and for cost. Sulfide solid state has a clear advantage over oxide/ceramic based ones that have to be thicker both for ionic conductivity reasons and for brittleness reasons.

Interfacial Connection: think  of a relay race. The ionic conductivity is how fast the runners can run but the interface between the cathode->solid electrolyte->anode is like the baton exchange in a relay race. This is where SSB's tend to struggle. But it turns out, with sulfide based electrolyte layers high stack pressure can greatly improve the interfacial connection allowing for  a uniform and seamless connection between the layers of battery. (*hint, Enovix architecture easily provides stack pressure).

Hot spots and heat transfer issues. The liquid electrolyte doesn't just transfer the ions effectively,      it also transfer heat around the cell, bringing it to the edge of the cell where it can cooled. Without that liquid electrolyte, even though its less flammable, those hot spots will kill cycle life and cause degradation issues if not dealt with. *If only there were a perfect architecture for thermal control.

Dendrites in a lithium metal anode. Sulfide based SSB are considered more prone to dendrites than oxide      based SSB's. This is likely why NIO, makes their semi-solid state battery based on a sulfide layer with a prelithiated Si-C mix on the anode side rather than the lithium metal side. (I wonder who else can do that anode side trick‚Ä¶.but at a much higher % of Si-C?)

Moisture sensitivity: sulfides are extremely sensitive to moisture and current manufacturers like Toyota have worked to use additives and coatings that make it less      so.

Manufacturability: Can you make the electrolyte? Once you've made that, can you then use it when      manufacturing the cell itself? Sulfide based electrolytes are extremely sensitive to moisture and oxygen, and using them to make a cell would likely require at least some of the steps to be done in a pure argon or a pure nitrogen environment, which means lights off automation would be required for those steps.

I don't want to understate the challenge here. Being able to allow ion transfer in a solid electrolyte is incredibly challenging to make happen in a cell, and incredibly difficult to manufacture in a scalable process. But there are at least two companies (Nio and Cherry) already taking this trick to production ready cells in China, and companies like Toyota/Samsung/Solid Power all have made incredible progress. Sulfide based SSB's are clearly stepping out of the proof of concept stage and starting to be ready for the next level. If you add in an architecture that easily adds stack pressure and thermal control, you might be on to something‚Ä¶

$ENVX

We've now made it to the cathode side of this super battery equation. Sulfur based cathodes. Unlike every single other battery cathode on the marketplace today that is intercalating, sulfur is a conversion style cathode. That means it forms an alloy with the lithium and can store much Much MUCH more lithium than anything else on the market. It's also incredibly abundant, cheap, and light.

So why the hell are you just hearing about it now? Did an anon on Twitter discover this wonder battery material under everyone's nose? Of course not. Sulfur is the definition of the two-faced supermodel. It's amazing in some respects, and atrocious in other respects. If you can find a way to cover its weaknesses, you have a potential super battery.

What are those weaknesses? First and foremost you have serious cycle life issues resulting from ""polysulfide shuttling."" Lithium sulfur undergoes multiple reactions when it takes in and then releases lithium and in this process tiny ""polysulfides"" can escape to the anode side and this absolutely wrecks any hope of cycle life you had with the battery. Current lithium sulfur cathode makers are trying to mitigate this by using various carbon products to trap the polysulfides before they shuttle away.

But it turns out there is a much more effective way to contain the number 1 problem of polysulfide shuttling. The solution is to pair sulfur based cathodes with sulfide based solid state electrolytes. This 100% filters out any polysulfides shutting all the way to the anode. 100%. Now there likely still is some impact from cathode side only polysulfide shuttling, but we're talking 95% of the problem is solved for you if you can pair sulfur cathode with sulfide electrolyte.

So once again, did I, an anon on twitter just discover this amazing trick that has eluded battery chemists for decades? Of course not. As a conversion style cathode, Sulfur expands and contracts by up to 80% of its volume in charge and discharge. This means that the number one unsolved problem for SSB's, that of interfacial contact between the layers, becomes virtually impossible to do with sulfur based cathodes making the point moot. 

But what if you have a battery architecture that can easily add in extremely high stack pressure in such a way that the expansion is controlled. The interface between the particles even in a sulfur cathode are perfectly uniform and perfectly in contact with a sulfide based electrolyte? That's exactly what Enovix can do. 

But sulfur's amazing potential isn't purely held back by polysulfide shuttling. It also is known for very low power output. We're talking 0.1 C power output (weak sauce), when the batteries required for drones are going to need to be on the order of 10C. This is where the work of the cathode manufacturers pairing it with new types of easily made carbon are making massive amounts of progress. Multiple companies and universities are now testing lithium sulfur based cathodes that are both high capacity and high power now, unheard of only a few years ago.

The next downside to sulfur unfortunately is volumetric density. Gravimetrically it is untouchable. Volumetrically it is weak. Cathode makers have to use low sulfur loading to increase its power output and also a lot of binder to glue it together during its expansion and contraction. In addition, they try to space it out pretty far apart to allow for said expansion and contraction. Once again, the Enovix high stack pressure can make a dramatic difference here. It can greatly reduce the amount of binder required, and the mechanical system is designed for the stuff to be packed in tight, because it is a conversion class battery designed to handle the swell.

The final problem I will discuss is one of heat. All Enovix investors know, the secret to extreme fast charge is rapid and uniform heat extraction from the center of the cell during charging. Fast charge brings in a ton of resistive heating related to bringing all that power in at once. But lesser known, is the fact that most intercalating cathode materials have a slightly endothermic reaction when the cathode gives up the lithium during charging. This means the chemical reaction that occurs during charging of say an LCO cathode, actually reduces the heat in the cell not adds to it. But sulfur is different. When it gives up the lithium, that multi stage reaction is exothermic at every stage. Meaning, if you want to fast charge you now have to get the resistive heat (resistive heat is why a toaster gets hot) out as well as the heat from the chemical reaction itself. And to add pain to this equation, if you're doing all of this in a solid state battery, you don't have a liquid that can rapidly transfer the heat from the center of the cell to the edge. If you don't have a battery form factor/architecture specifically designed for rapid heat extraction, you are going to create hotspots that kill the cycle life of your battery.

Hopefully now you are starting to see why having a battery that can provide high stack pressure and extreme thermal control is not just a nice to have, but is absolutely crucial to making this type of battery work.

$ENVX

We're now to the anode side. I won't belabor this point because everyone knows this is already where Enovix shines. It takes 100% Si-C, prelithiates it, and then uses that anode side advantage in conjunction with regular LCO on the cathode to create the AI-1 battery that is about to take the high margin consumer electronics space by storm.

I will reiterate, that the knock on sulfide based solid state electrolyte is that it is more prone to dendrite formation when compared with oxide based SSB. So while sulfides are basically twice as ionically conductive allowing it to be much thinner (both lighter and more volumetrically dense), it may not be as reliable when using lithium metal. Well, the very easy solution to this is to use si on the anode side, especially if you're partnering with a si anode expert.

BTW, NIO currently makes semi-solid state batteries (using traditional cathode materials and retaining half the liquid weight because its only semi solid state), and they use si on the anode side presumably for this exact reason. In real world conditions, the only route to get to extremely high cycle life for this type of battery is si on the anode side not li metal imho.

$ENVX

Let me summarize. There is a whisper of a dream for a potential battery that would not just be an upgrade to existing batteries, it would be a world changing technology that future historians would list alongside the invention of the steam engine. But in order to achieve this multiple miracles from an entire ecosystem of companies and universities would have to happen in parallel and the subcomponents all have to work in concert to hide each other's weaknesses.

But, in theory.....

1) The main weakness of the  sulfur based cathode (polysulfide shuttling) can be solved by using a      sulfide based SSB

2) The main weakness of a SSB, especially when paired with an expanding and contracting sulfur based      cathode (interfacial connectivity), can be solved by high stack pressure easily achieved using Enovix architecture.

3) The second main weakness for sulfur based cathodes of volumetric density, can be dramatically improved by the high stack pressure easily achieved using Enovix Architecture.

4) The serious problem of dendrite formation from a sulfide based SSB can be solved using pre lithiated si on the anode side rather than li metal, a technique Enovix has already perfected.

5) The serious problems regarding heat extraction and thermal control that would come from a sulfur based cathode having exothermic reactions during charging, and made  worse by an all solid battery without the liquid electrolyte to transfer heat around, would have to be solved by a battery architecture that      specifically enables rapid and uniform heat extraction.

All of this would have to be manufactured by teams of experts capable of manufacturing in extreme      environments. Microchip manufacturers do that every day.

Other problems like power output for sulfur based cathodes or ionic conductivity for sulfide based solid electrolytes are immensely challenging, but appear to be being solved by multiple companies as we speak. Enovix potentially can serve as the architecture and partner that enables it all. 

Now the beauty of this whole thing is, it's not a zero to 1 proposition for Enovix. As we speak, Enovix is about to capitalize on being able to produce batteries with JUST the anode side of this equation. The AI-1 battery that is north of 900 Wh/L, has a 3C charge rate, high cycle life, and AI enabling power output is the result of only one side of this equation paired with an LCO cathode. And after that, if they're challenged they'll implement a higher voltage cathode (likely specially coated LCO) to continue their dominance. But in the background, they can be working on bringing together the next gen battery ecosystem required to make this much bigger dream happen. Maybe the next step is just the SSB side. And then the final step would be the sulfur cathode paired with it all. This is all wildly speculative, but extremely exciting. It should at least be known that these potential tech tree combinations appear to be coming together. 

Enovix, come for smartphone opportunity, stay for the chance to change the world. Good luck out there. || $ENVX Enovix Corp undertaking transformative battery tech DD on $ENVX Enovix Batteries Corp (posted on behalf of 2percentisfair on X)

Most battery tech journalism is frustrating because you will hear constant tales of a tech that will double or triple battery capacity, and then of course the change never happens. The reason for this is multi-faceted:

1) what works in a lab often doesn't work in real world conditions,
2) battery materials are like two faced super-models they can be absolutely perfect when looking at one metric, but can have debilitating shortcomings when looking at another, and

3) most of the time you need to see 100 different success stories in parallel to make a dramatic change happen, and the article speaks of the 1 improvement only and speaks as if the other 99 problems have already been solved.

The AI-1 battery that is north of 900 Wh/L, has a 3C charge rate, high cycle life, and AI enabling power output is the result of only one side of this equation paired with an LCO cathode. And after that, if they're challenged they'll implement a higher voltage cathode (likely specially coated LCO) to continue their dominance. But in the background, they can be working on bringing together the next gen battery ecosystem required to make this much bigger dream happen. Maybe the next step is just the SSB side. And then the final step would be the sulfur cathode paired with it all. This is all wildly speculative, but extremely exciting. It should at least be known that these potential tech tree combinations appear to be coming together. 

Enovix, come for smartphone opportunity, stay for the chance to change the world. Good luck out there.",stocks,4.0,94.0,92.32166544596355,92.32166544596355

üêØ Tiger Brokers ( $TIGR ) is clawing its way to the top of Oceania's digital brokerage jungle and it's doing it with haste, roaring fundamentals and stealth...  
  
üí°Simple thesis, if we just assume $TIGR is the worst broker, it still has the fundamentals supporting a double BUT I will also demonstrate by comparison why it is actually a crazy growth opportunity. You can even get hands on yourself without an account and explore some of the app- ‚û°Ô∏è Tiger Trade ‚¨ÖÔ∏è on the respective app store(s).  
  
üìù Small note, *I wrote this all by hand, got the data by manually and made the charts by hand, no AI. If you think this is AI you don't know shit, STFU and say thank-you before you move on to spamming posts with ""Old WSB had real DD now its just meme stock posts"".*  
  
üìä OK, lets start with Fundamental Comparisons, I've made pretty pictures for you:  
  
$TIGR $HOOD $FUTU 

[Most importantly, the last chart, it has room to 5x the marketcap.](https://preview.redd.it/rf937nhdimef1.png?width=1661&format=png&auto=webp&s=8abf8a7a56e6ac772aa91c87f608bfce08144547)

# **Outrageously Undervalued.**



üí∏ Lets talk about cash flow Cash Flow. P/C (Price to Cash) = 0.5. Insane. $TIGR has so much cash that it's enterprise value is negative, that means if you bought all of $TIGR at its current market cap, including paying all its debt you would have more cash then you spent buying the company. How much would you profit? About 1.5 Billion (‚úåÔ∏èdouble-up) 



üõí This could also make it a potential target for acquisition, it has a smart team + tons of global regulatory approvals already. Meanwhile $HOOD has been working on Singapore approval for nearly a year now.



üç¥ $TIGR Q1 earnings was for the giant drawdown period and it still looked amazing. Since then we've had a jarringly fast recovery and new Crypto highs, expect Q2 to be a huge beat, analysts are out to lunch.



üéâ I think a **24%** surprise beat on revenue and **100%** beat on earnings.

\- Revenue/Earning Estimate      |   118M / $0.10

\- Revenue/Earnings Prediction   |   146M / $0.20



üò§ ""Yeah but-""

but what if $HOOD comes to Oceania? 

\- $HOOD is more expensive and doesn't actually have more features than $TIGR, it would be hard to convince people to switch who already use a platform just like $HOOD but pay much less for it. Admittedly Robinhood does have a better user experience and I would say their UI implementation is bar none the best for retail.



but $FUTU is bigger and safer!

\- It is bigger and safer annnnnd has less room to appreciate, already trading at a premium to $TIGR but I'd say its still undervalued as well. Both stocks move with each other fairly consistently, I just prefer the one with more reward for my risk. $TIGR can increase it's profit margin 2x and its user base (to a lesser degree) if it does that in 2026 the stock will trade at $40+.  



but if Trump delists China Stocks its fked!

\- $TIGR is based in Singapore. It serves clients in Singapore, Australia, New Zealand, China and even the US.



but you didn't show up $HOOD EPS Y/Y, its > 1000%, way more than any other broker!

\- Every company EPS looks amazing coming from NEGATIVE earnings, I provided the positive Q/Q.



but it already ran up!

\- Good stocks go up smh, I just posted all the reasons why it has so much more room, above, in picture form, for your smooth brain.



üí∞ Wealth Management = Sticky Growth

Tiger is leaning heavily into Wealth Management, adding high-quality revenue streams and stickiness. Think Schwab or IBKR, but at an earlier and cheaper stage. This is a great fit for the region which is now transitioning to stock investments at a higher rate due to turmoil over the last few decades in real-estate markets.

37% - Institutions (Volume shows recent large buy June 25th at pre-market open, likely institutional, closed +22% that day)

**üêØ TLDR; $TIGR**



‚úÖ Feature Rich ‚úÖ Fast Development ‚úÖ Free AI Assistant ‚úÖ Gamified ‚úÖ Sticky Products



ü´∞ Massive valuation gap vs. peers. $TIGR could double and still look cheaper than all the competition.



ü§ë Best-in-class earning per share with plenty of room to improve profit margins all while having 3 years of profitable history and more cash on hand than its entire marketcap + debt.



üì¢ Smart expansion into high-value regions and dominating early with profitable marketing.



üß† Management execution has been impressive. They're beating guidance handidly and scaling products/features.



üí• Explosive growth year after year, consistent CAGR that has been overlooked somehow.

üéª How I am playing it:

I usually take a bit of profit before strike hits on big moves, rest of calls will be sold at or slightly above strike with the exception of the Sept calls which I may hold past the strike depending how well I feel they did on earnings and general market conditions. Every position sold is reinvested into calls until earnings, post earnings calls will be sold for shares.

I've run the same possibilities now at 5.5% and, obviously, feeling less optimistic.

CME,2025-07-24,US,"Who will buy bonds if interest rates drop? Answer: A lot of people \*EDIT\* Lol it's so comical to me that people think ""Jap"" is a derogatory term. I have to advise that there's even gravestones where I live marking people as ""Japnanee"" - not even using the term ""Japanese"". And these are gravestones both in Japanese Kanji and in Latinized transliteration, made by the people themselves. People here refer to themselves as Japs, Nips, Nihos, Nons, Japanee, and a few other things. Maybe the Woke ""losers"" who think everything is an insult and ""white nationalism"" or whatever, should pull their own heads out of their ass.

The truth is that many people (net) are short bonds. They are short bonds by taking out loans, they are directly short bonds, they are short derivatives of bonds.

Right now, COT reports for CME shorts on bonds, total: == $2.19 Trillion.

The US only needs to roll over $7 Trillion in short term debt, and here you have over $2Trillion in direct short-futures on bonds greater than 2 years.

Just lowering interest rates will liquidate 2/7ths, nearly 1/3rd worth of all US short-term treasuries and bills needing to roll over into long term positions.

So who will buy 1% Treasuries? That guy.

The bozo that is shorting bonds.

Who will buy 1% treasuries? The MBS salesman who packaged a 6% Mortgage tranche and now those mortgages are refinancing at 1%prime rates and needs to be REPACKAGED. How many MBSs exist that need collateral at the new rate? I don't have the answer in front of me, but the answer exists. It's quantifiable with the right data. It's probably over $1Trillion. The Mortgage Securities market is $11 Trillion large.

I'm sure more than $1 Trillion of that market will need to refinance their MBS collaterals with 1% treasuries.

Who else will buy 1% treasuries? The foreigner who earned money exporting plastic-dog-poop keychains to the US and needs to take that dollar and put it anywhere except in currency because of currency risk.

Who will buy bonds at lower interest rates? Answer? Enough people will that the US will continue to be gangster. Anyone betting against the US is and always will be a loser.

Just ask the Japs and the Germans.

Hell, they'll buy the remaining short-duration paper at gunpoint, for 0% yield.

CMG,2025-07-22,US,"[DD] The Value Play Cycle Needs Its Third: Why I'm Betting on DNUT Alright degenerates, we need to talk. OPEN ripped. KSS followed. But these cycles always come in threes, and we're missing the final piece.

**""History doesn't repeat but it does rhyme""** \- so what's the next verse?

I think it's DNUT. But if you've got a better idea, drop it in the comments. Here's my case:

# The Setup: OPEN your ahole and KSS DNUTz

Yeah, I went there. But while everyone's drunk on the first two gains, there's a $560M market cap company trading at bankruptcy multiples despite growing revenue.

**Current Price: $3.58**  
**Market Cap: $560M**  
**My Target: $8-12**

Show me another 2-3x opportunity this obvious.

# The Valuation Gap Is Insane

Look at these multiples and tell me this makes sense:

|Company|EV/EBITDA|EV/Sales|Context|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|**DNUT**|**9.2x**|**1.2x**|Priced for bankruptcy despite growth|
|Starbucks|18.9x|3.57x|Premium coffee valuation|
|Restaurant Brands|17.0x|\~5x|Tim Hortons/BK parent|
|Dunkin' (2020 sale)|**23x**|N/A|What buyers actually pay for donuts|

Yet DNUT is:

* Operating **17,982 points of access globally**
* Posted 5% organic growth in FY2024
* Has one of the most recognized brands in food

Find me another company this disconnected from fundamentals.

# The Bear Cases Are All Weak

**""Ozempic will kill fast food""** \- I'm a fatass myself and there's no amount of Ozempic that removes my craving for hot, fresh donuts at 2am. Look at MCD and CMG at ATHs. People on Ozempic eat less, not never. A glazed donut is 190 calories of pure dopamine - that demand isn't disappearing.

**""The McDonald's deal ended!""** \- No, the TEST ended after rolling out to 2,400 stores. You think McDonald's spent millions on infrastructure for a 3-month trial? They're analyzing data. If it worked (spoiler: donuts + coffee = money), this goes nationwide.

**""They suspended the dividend!""** \- Good. They're investing in growth instead of paying boomers. That's exactly what you want in a turnaround.

# Three Ways This Plays Out

**Starting Point:**

* Stock: $3.58
* Market Cap: $560M
* Growing business with fixable issues

**Scenario 1: Modest Re-rate (12x EBITDA)**

Still way below peers:

* **Target: $8-9**
* **Return: 125-150%**

**Scenario 2: Industry Average (15x)**

If operations improve:

* **Target: $11-13**
* **Return: 200-250%**

**Scenario 3: Nothing Changes (10x)**

Status quo maintained:

* **Target: $5-6**
* **Return: 40-70%**

Even the bear case would be a healthy return on your money. Show me better risk/reward.

# Why The Setup Is Perfect

‚úì **Meme-able ticker** (DNUT - come on)  
‚úì **Small cap** ($560M = moves fast)  
‚úì **Value play** (half peer multiples)  
‚úì **Real business** (17,982 locations)  
‚úì **Catalyst rich** (McDonald's decision pending)  
‚úì **Acquisition target** (at these multiples) ‚úì **Options flow confirming** (Huge call buying at $5 strike)

# Recent ""Problems"" Are Actually Bullish

* **Q1 revenue down 1%** ‚Üí They sold Insomnia Cookies (portfolio cleanup)
* **Dividend suspended** ‚Üí More cash for growth/turnaround
* **McDonald's test ""ended""** ‚Üí Infrastructure built, awaiting expansion
* **Debt concerns** ‚Üí Manageable at 5x EBITDA, becomes nothing if margins improve

Every QSR turnaround story looks exactly like this before the re-rate.

# But Here's Where I Need Your Input

I'm convinced DNUT is the third play because:

1. **Valuation** \- It's the most undervalued name I can find
2. **Size** \- Small enough to move like OPEN and KSS did
3. **Catalysts** \- McDonald's decision, margin improvements, M&A potential
4. **Meme factor** \- The ticker alone guarantees viral potential
5. **Options flow** \- Big money is already positioning

But maybe I'm missing something. What else fits the pattern?

* Under $1B market cap?
* Trading at distressed multiples?
* Has clear catalysts ahead?
* Meme-able enough for WSB?
* Seeing unusual options activity?

Drop your picks below. But until someone shows me better risk/reward than 7:1 upside, I'm loading DNUT.

# Someone's Already Loading - Check the Options Flow

Here's what really got my attention: MASSIVE call buying the past few days, absolutely exploding today. The $5 strikes are getting hammered with volume.

Someone with deep pockets is betting big on a move above $5. That's a 40% move from here, and they're paying premium for it. When smart money moves this aggressively on a small cap, you pay attention.

This isn't retail buying weeklies. This is institutional-sized flow betting on a re-rate.

[past week](https://preview.redd.it/xcxfleepngef1.png?width=2142&format=png&auto=webp&s=b69b385edf49636702af95a44e47b6c3d3038751)

[today](https://preview.redd.it/1od3hcy7qgef1.png?width=2150&format=png&auto=webp&s=0af667fdfc86245bc643c1a068a79688b06447dd)

# The Play

The options market is telling you something. When you see this kind of call buying on a beaten-down small cap with clear catalysts, it usually means someone knows something.

Those $5 calls? If DNUT hits just the LOW end of fair value ($8), those are 10-15x. If it hits $12? Those calls print harder than JPow in 2020.

I like the 11/21 $5 call. IV is only at 87% and volume is sufficient at 2k+

https://preview.redd.it/9lghn7dwqgef1.png?width=1858&format=png&auto=webp&s=6e3f654e56abef9da84cf86b0b6c83fa3e7757b2

**My Position:**

https://preview.redd.it/s2v1a859sgef1.png?width=1900&format=png&auto=webp&s=1c006ba69e418e6820ad3344bd8773fd44756bc9

The first two already ran. Don't be late to the third.

Because when McDonald's announces the national rollout, when margins tick up even 100bps, when some PE firm offers 15x EBITDA - this thing gaps to $8+ overnight.

Every distressed QSR (finance bro speak for fast food) that fixed itself got bought:

* Dunkin': 23x EBITDA to Inspire Brands
* Panera: Bought by JAB
* Popeyes: Acquired by RBI
* Buffalo Wild Wings: Taken private by Roark

At current multiples, DNUT is a sitting duck.

The cycle comes in threes:  
OPEN ‚úì  
KSS ‚úì  
???

I say DNUT. The options flow says DNUT. Prove us wrong.

CRL,2025-07-23,US,"408K -> 800K YOLO INTO IOVA AND WHY THIS IS JUST THE START **TLDR: IOVA's current rise marks the very beginning of a year-long short squeeze. Both the technical and fundamental set-up (34.5% short interest) makes this one of the best opportunities I have seen in a very long while. A price target of 10-15$ is very achievable.**

Two months ago I posted a 408K YOLO into IOVA with ten points of DD (I highly recommend you read this if you haven't already as I outline the basics of the company + main theses there): [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1kqhzj0/408k\_yolo\_into\_iova/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1kqhzj0/408k_yolo_into_iova/)

Since then, the stock has risen over 80% on multiple positive updates and my position grew to 800K (after I also added \~12k shares). I believe that a few recent developments, however, are so substantial that they warrant a new post, and my conviction in the stock has never been higher.

**Fundamentals are improving rapidly - much faster than sell-side and shorts expected:**

1. Replimune's RP1 was IOVA's biggest competitive threat, and the **rejection of their flagship therapy by the FDA yesterday** means that Amtagvi will be able to maintain its monopoly in the late-stage melanoma field: [https://ir.replimune.com/news-releases/news-release-details/replimune-receives-complete-response-letter-fda-rp1-biologics](https://ir.replimune.com/news-releases/news-release-details/replimune-receives-complete-response-letter-fda-rp1-biologics)

Investors who have been following the stock should know just how much of a threat REPL seemed to IOVA, and how bullish the CRL is for IOVA's operations in the next few years. This is especially the case given that IOVA has been trying to make the push into being used at earlier stages. REPL's stock dropping 77.24% yesterday signals the market's belief that they will likely need to redo their study entirely, using randomized controlled studies this time.

2. **Recent commercial data from IOVA has been very, very, very impressive**. A July 14 study found that Amtagvi's ORR among real world patients who have received multiple lines of prior therapies was **49%**. For patients who have received 2 lines of therapies or less, the ORR was **60.9%**: [https://ir.iovance.com/news-releases/news-release-details/real-world-data-demonstrate-49-response-rate-commercial-amtagvir](https://ir.iovance.com/news-releases/news-release-details/real-world-data-demonstrate-49-response-rate-commercial-amtagvir)

https://preview.redd.it/pzazo1mq8lef1.png?width=2532&format=png&auto=webp&s=30b1ef07a462b0a57fbb7cbb9ac4b418f194748a

This is truly **miracle-drug level numbers for melanoma**, and hence the widespread excitement in the medical industry. Many of these responses were also highly durable lasting many years following a single treatment. In other words, for many patients who have tried and failed other therapies and thus are losing hope, Amtagvi provides a 49% chance of extending your lifespan by years (and a chance of complete recovery). The fact that 250m Americans are covered by insurance for this treatment means that the 500k treatment cost is manageable for consumers, but represents significant revenue for IOVA. Here is an excellent video from the Director of Melanoma Medical Oncology at the Stanford Cancer Center discussing the therapy:¬†[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hvr10OA\_DJc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hvr10OA_DJc)

https://preview.redd.it/alpyhir3elef1.png?width=2500&format=png&auto=webp&s=cb2314be33b4c4c81090049aab20d48463b85425

Such data, along with the rejection of RP1, will help them push into earlier lines of therapy, enabling a  rapid revenue ramp up over the coming year. Management forecasts a steady state of 1bn in annual revenue and 80% gross margins - which seems more and more achievable given the RP1 rejection.

3. **Q2 recovery is imminent with a stronger team**. In the Q1 earnings call, management has repeatedly mentioned that Q2 demand was very strong, and that they are capable of beating their lowered guidance. This was reinforced by physician comments during their Investor Event at ASCO where they mentioned that treatments really picked up in April: [https://ir.iovance.com/events/event-details/iovance-biotherapeutics-asco-investor-event](https://ir.iovance.com/events/event-details/iovance-biotherapeutics-asco-investor-event)

Their strategy of moving into earlier treatment stages and utilizing community referrals will also play out over the next year under the new CCO Dan Kirby (who seems to be highly competent - you can find him speaking here: [https://ir.iovance.com/events/event-details/goldman-sachs-46th-annual-global-healthcare-conference](https://ir.iovance.com/events/event-details/goldman-sachs-46th-annual-global-healthcare-conference)

The new CFO, Corleen Roche, who joined from the more established CG Oncology also brings much needed experience to the team (she has worked in the field for 30+ years). 

**Technicals - one of the most insane short-squeeze set ups I've seen**

1. The stock is currently one of the most heavily shorted tickers out there, with **short interest at 34.53%.** By comparison, OPEN only has a short interest of **20.7%** **and the fundamental improvement of IOVA > OPEN by a significant margin.** 

https://preview.redd.it/nyodjhet5lef1.png?width=2340&format=png&auto=webp&s=12cc9db4b6c715dd86a4313f4e29a025849a371d

Furthermore, **81.33% of shares are held by institutions** (with 8.41% held by Wayne Rothbaum, one of the most successful biotech investors of all time who also sits on the board), and **17.97% are held by mutual funds**. This means that the amount of shares traded among retail is very limited (0.32% OS), further improving the technical set up and the potential for a squeeze. 

https://preview.redd.it/bmdes461blef1.png?width=1864&format=png&auto=webp&s=2b2dd815fecfd2008fe8cdd3ecf912d1efd49369

**For a short squeeze to not be a short-lived pump and dump, the fundamentals must justify the short squeeze** (many forget this). In this case, it seems that the **hedges who drove the 34.53% short interest has been caught with their pants down**, as the fundamentals improved significantly faster than they expected. Indeed, much faster than I expected as well and I have been closely following the stock for a while and am biased to be long given the hype from my friends in pharma.

**Here are my positions, I will not sell a single share until my price target of 10$+.**

$XLE and its constituents have a major problem even if the US doesn't enter a recession (which is my base case).

1. Japan can't afford more oil
2. Saudi Arabia has openly stated last OPEC meeting in Vienna a few days ago that their goal is to now drive US Drillers out of business in the Permian patch.

The last time #2 happened was in 2014 where oil prices crashed pretty hard and bankrupted a lot of oil companies and caused the current oil majors to promise shareholders ""never again"" with ""capital restructuring"".

Saudi Arabia absolutely can drive US driller out of business for a simple reason. Most of their fields cost \~$30/bbl to produce. And most of the US permian basin costs \~$72/bbl to produce.

But the added problem is #1. Japan's currency problems is that even with falling dollar value relative to the basket, yen is also still falling. Thus the yen is ""low value"" which helps Japanese exports but hurts imports. And Japan imports 100% of all their oil. The Yen wavers these past few years between recession territory and massively inside recession territory. Since the Russia war Japan has not been able to catch a break and their stimulus to generate inflation has been gobbled up by a need to raise subsidies to pay workers to buy gasoline or diesel. Otherwise the typical Japanese under-middle class income range can't afford oil products at all.

Oil price is very closely tied to the ability of Japan to pay for oil. So unless the value of the Yen rises measurably against the dollar, Japan is stuck in recessionary territory.",investing,1.0,150.0399932861328,150.50749969482422,150.50749969482422

Selling RIOT, MSTX which were my bitcoin exposures.

Possibly keeping TMC (which I believe in the Deep Sea mining tech). But It's hard to keep something so volatile as a deep sea mine, mining is hard enough.

Will most likely keep:  
JEPQ (I see no reason not to just hold and DCA).

F (Such a good cost basis that I think I'll just keep it as is).

MO

PFE

HRZN (A risky but good historically dividend payer. It risks lower NAV due to IPO drought which will only get worse, but it has a great basket of companies it does private financing with).

TLTW  
TMF (which are my bond exposure, not principal secured).

I have direct bond ownership as well, so I moved over all of my:  
NVDA, MSFT into direct bond ownership at 170 and 500 prices respectively.

This market is just a clown show. People said ""earnings are better now than before"" but they actually aren't. The earnings are ""better"" because of a declining dollar. Which is fine, but that's not the same as ""PE is good"".

The market is grossly over valued going into an earnings recession at best. At worst we get a massive housing crisis that crushes earnings for 30% of the US economy, and a debt crisis that crushes earnings for MSFT, NVDA, META, GOOG, AMZN, etc.

The two halves of the economy that usually plays one off the other are both staring at their own disasters.

What I will buy later.

JEPQ after QQQ corrects (whatever that looks like).  
GLD if 20% drop in gold.  
Bitcoin at $80,000 to $90,000 this cycle.  
CCJ if a 30% or greater correction.  
TMC (if I sell) if it drops to 200day.  
KO if dividend yield reaches 3.3%

D,2025-07-18,US,"Beyond Defense: The REAL Innovation Play in Europe Needs a Speed Boost 
Hey r/investing and r/europe!

We've all seen the massive surge in defense stocks lately, and for good reason. But what about the other critical innovation sectors bubbling up in Europe that could be huge long-term plays?

I'm talking about areas like:

Electric Vehicles (EVs) & EV Batteries: Europe is pushing hard to build its own EV champions and secure its battery supply chain. We're seeing more affordable models hitting the market and significant investment in gigafactories. The competition with Asian manufacturers is fierce, but Europe's focus on sustainability and innovation (e.g., in battery cell production emissions) could be a differentiator.

Next-Gen Energy Generation (SMRs): Small Modular Reactors are gaining serious traction as a clean, reliable, and scalable energy source. The European Industrial Alliance on SMRs is pushing for deployment by the early 2030s, with significant government and industry support. This is a massive market with global export potential.

Now, here's the kicker: What do all these cutting-edge sectors desperately need to succeed and gain a global competitive edge?

They need to speed up research, reduce lag time, and slash development costs.

Think about it: Why build ten physical prototypes when you only need one, or even better, none to get to the optimal design? The traditional R&D cycle is slow, expensive, and resource-intensive.

This is where companies like Dassault Syst√®mes come in.

Dassault Syst√®mes, through their 3DEXPERIENCE platform, is fundamentally changing how innovation happens. They enable companies to create ""virtual twins"" ‚Äì highly accurate digital models of products, processes, and even entire systems.

Imagine:

Virtually testing EV battery chemistries down to the molecular level, without building countless physical cells.

Simulating the performance of a new SMR design under extreme conditions before cutting any steel.

Optimizing manufacturing lines for EVs or battery production in a digital environment, catching errors before they cost millions.

This kind of simulation-driven design and virtual prototyping allows for:

Massive cost reduction: Fewer physical prototypes mean less material waste and less manufacturing time.

Accelerated time-to-market: Iterating designs virtually is exponentially faster.

Enhanced innovation: Engineers can explore thousands of design variations and test radical ideas that would be too costly or risky in the physical world.

Improved product quality: Catching errors early leads to better, more reliable products.

So, while defense is soaring, keep an eye on these other European innovation sectors. And consider the ""picks and shovels"" plays like Dassault Syst√®mes that are enabling this rapid technological advancement. They're not just selling software; they're selling speed and efficiency, which are invaluable currencies in the race for future dominance.

And so do ""Econ101"", And your snide remarks don't change anything. A ""Gambler's psychology 101"" course would straighten you out. Markets aren't economic S&D curves. That stuff is for ""ideal lab scenarios"". Markets are behavioral economics at best. And do the opposite what a sterile classroom says should happen because people don't care about fundamentals, they care about results. And they behave panicky and exuberantly in markets.*

Someone asked such a fundamental question that I need to respond with a separate post for a full on discussion.

But, supply increases when price decreases, contrary to ""logic"" because of behavioral economics. The logical thought is the higher the price the more people want to sell but this is not true at all.

Search your own hearts and you'll see quite plainly why. Like gamblers on a winning streak we don't want to quit when we're ahead, we want to double our bets, make even more money, feel even ""better"".

When prices rise, we remove supply because everyone is doing the same thing. They are doubling down, seeing how far it can go, they are complacent, they are squeezing the price even higher self-fulfilling the prophecy that the market can never ever go down.

The opposite is true when prices fall. People become afraid, people sell out of fear of losing their gains, or fear of losing more. Typically the latter.

People are willing to sacrifice gains, they'll hold out hoping for even higher returns. Until they lose all their return, then they are in denial. ""It can't go down forever. It'll come back, surely this will pass"".

And of course, an investor who's survived a few of these will hold. But typically a bottom price is found when ""everyone dumps"".

When everyone throws in the towel and sells at that price. That's a deluge of volume, not a trickle. That's when prices bottom.

When people become so fearful that everyone ends up on the same side of the trade, selling instead of buying.

Behaviorally that's how people create supply in a decreasing price environment.

It's really quite simple when you are just honest with your own behavior. How many of you have ""sold the bottom"" only to feel like a fool because prices came right back?

How many of you have bought the top because  you were over excited and the prices fell and you had to ""wait"" for profit or it never came back to prior highs?

We've all done it.

The point is that EVERYONE does it. And because EVERYONE does it...that's why supply increases when prices fall. And why buyers (demand) increases when prices rise.

D,2025-07-24,US,"Figma IPO Overview and Valuation Estimation **Figma IPO Overview and Valuation**

Figma, a leading collaborative design software company, recently published an updated prospectus for its initial public offering. The company expects to offer approximately 37 million shares at a price range of¬†$25 to $28¬†per share, implying gross proceeds of up to¬†$1 billion, including sales by both the company and existing shareholders.

This IPO pricing would value Figma at a¬†fully diluted equity valuation of approximately $14.6 to $16.4 billion. For context, Figma was last valued at¬†$12.5 billion¬†in a 2024 secondary transaction. In 2022, Adobe had announced plans to acquire Figma for¬†$20 billion, but the deal was ultimately terminated due to regulatory concerns.

**Business Model and Competitive Positioning**

Figma operates as a B2B SaaS provider focused on collaborative design and prototyping tools for designers and developers. Its primary competition includes Adobe XD and other legacy design platforms.

Key business characteristics:

* **High gross margins**¬†(estimated at \~85%)
* **Recurring revenue model**, with strong net dollar retention
* **Product-led growth**, driven by bottom-up adoption within organizations
* **Network effects**, as collaboration increases with team usage

**Moat Assessment**

Figma demonstrates a strong to formidable competitive moat:

* **Switching Costs**: High. Design and engineering teams often build core workflows on Figma, making migration costly and disruptive.
* **Network Effects**: Moderate to strong. Real-time collaboration enhances value as team adoption increases.
* **Brand Strength**: Among design professionals, Figma enjoys near cult-like loyalty and recognition.

**Financial Snapshot (Est. FY2023)**

|Metric|Estimate|
|:-|:-|
|Revenue|\~$600 million|
|YoY Growth|\~40‚Äì45%|
|Gross Margin|\~85%|
|Operating Margin|Likely negative (R&D-led)|
|Free Cash Flow|Near breakeven|
|IPO Valuation (@$28)|\~$16.4 billion (FD)|

**Intrinsic Value Estimate**

Assumptions:

* **Owner Earnings**: \~$60 million (10% margin on $600M revenue)
* **Growth**: 25% for next 5 years ‚Üí 10% for years 6‚Äì10 ‚Üí 4% thereafter
* **Discount Rate**: 10%
* **Terminal Multiple**: 15√ó Year 10 Owner Earnings

Projected Owner Earnings (forward 5 years):

|Year|Owner Earnings|
|:-|:-|
|1|$75M|
|2|$94M|
|3|$117M|
|4|$146M|
|5|$183M|

* Discounted cash flows (Years 1‚Äì5): \~$500M‚Äì$600M
* Terminal value (discounted): \~$2.75B
* Estimated intrinsic value: $3.3‚Äì3.5 billion

At \~585 million fully diluted shares, this implies a¬†fair value of approximately $18.50 per share.

**Conclusion**

Figma is a high-quality SaaS business with strong fundamentals, durable competitive advantages, and attractive long-term potential. However, based on a conservative DCF analysis, the proposed IPO pricing range appears¬†rich, with limited margin of safety at the top end. Long-term investors may prefer to wait for a more favorable entry point closer to intrinsic value (\~$18.50/share).

DASH,2025-07-18,US,"Understanding Your Next Play in Critical Minerals (DD) Hi all,

I wanted to touch base to tell you all about how I‚Äôve been considering new fund allocations across the sector, especially given that we have begun to see sizable upside. I also wanted to point out a potential catalyst across the industry broadly, but especially for particular minerals and rare earths.

**I. DASH, FAST-41, and YOU, a primer**

The federal government has a initiative called the **Defense Authorization for Strategic and High‚ÄëTech.**¬†Speaking in terms of minerals initiative‚Äîit presents as an¬†**investment/funding program**¬†linked to the DoD (and also relevant to DPA, DOE) aimed at accelerating U.S. supply chains in critical minerals (like graphite, rare earths, etc.). It focuses on¬†**grants, offtake agreements, and financial backing.**¬†They also have a dashboard called FAST-41. This is primarily for permitting and regulatory approvals related to infrastructure, including mining and critical minerals.

As we have seen with¬†[the recent MP <-> Pentagon deal](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/07/10/pentagon-to-become-largest-shareholder-in-rare-earth-magnet-maker-mp-materials.html), the US government isn‚Äôt joking around about providing significant backing to promising rare earth and critical minerals companies that process, mine, and develop product domestically. They have¬†[outright said it themselves](https://www.reuters.com/world/china/pentagon-keep-working-with-us-rare-earths-projects-us-defense-official-says-2025-07-15/)¬†\- they are aiming to provide more funding, and fast.

We can use DASH and FAST-41 to our advantage to help us make investment choices as this run extends across the industry. I expect further DoD funding to trickle in within the next few weeks. Here are some compelling contenders for federal funding and incentivization, analyzed by their relationship with the federal government (existing contracts, speculation, FAST designation, or beyond).

>**UCORE Rare Metals (UURAF)**: Strategically placed with exposure to both US and Canadian government investments, this company has compelling technology for the separation of Heavy Rare Earths.¬†[They have recently been awarded a DoD grant](https://ucore.com/ucore-launches-us-department-of-defense-funded-18-4-million-commercial-rare-earth-refining-project/).

>**Energy Fuels (UUUU)**: As both a uranium producer and a producer of rare earth oxides¬†[(most recently announcing heavy rare earth oxide production)](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/energy-fuels-now-producing-heavy-104500195.html), this company is well-poised for significant government investment.

>**American Battery Technology (ABAT)**: Leading in battery recycling, this company has relationships with big names like TESLA and ties to federal funds.

>**Graphite One (GPHOF):**¬†This company has the potential to be come a vertically integrated graphite source. China‚Äôs grip over graphite processing is equally as dominant as their grip over rare earth processing.

This one is as obvious a play as I have ever seen.

>**The Metals Company (TMC):**¬†High risk, high reward. They are awaiting permitting news in the next few months. Unprecedented plan to retrieve minerals from the ocean floor.

I also continue to believe in further upside at¬†**MP materials,**¬†despite their already magnificent run and news.

**II. Import Tariffs via Section 232**

In April, T[rump initiated a Section 232 investigation into the national security threat that critical minerals pose](https://www.whitehouse.gov/fact-sheets/2025/04/fact-sheet-president-donald-j-trump-ensures-national-security-and-economic-resilience-through-section-232-actions-on-processed-critical-minerals-and-derivative-products/).¬†[Likewise as with Copper,](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trump-announces-50-tariff-copper-effective-august-1-2025-07-10/)¬†and as we have seen with Graphite just yesterday (linked above), we are likely to see tariffs roll out on further minerals by way of this investigation. After the report is completed, Trump will have a short amount of time to decide whether to impose tariffs or not on the industry.

Which minerals, though? Theoretically, most of them, as they all are strategic to defense. However, our production capacity is not high for certain areas yet (e.g. heavy rare earths), so what will happen exactly is not known to me entirely.

That being said, we know that the administration is not afraid of stepping up to China boldly, nor are they afraid of import controls and tariffs. This is an area to watch carefully. I expect announcements in the next weeks to months, if not sooner.

Lithium in particular stands out to me. Chinese price-gouging of the spot price has made it almost impossible for domestic producers to be able to compete. Take that information as you wish!

That‚Äôs all for now folks.

üîπ Alaska Airlines (ALK): up 0.9% premarket. Operations have now resumed despite a nationwide flight suspension due to an IT outage. Both the company and its subsidiaries have suffered recent cybersecurity incidents, which may prompt them to step up their IT investments in the future.

EQT,2025-07-21,US,"AI Action Day This Wednesday I posted a couple days ago expressing my view that money can be made by being on top of trump's agenda, policy-related news, etc. I'm not saying its easy, but I think in several instances so far this year, the ""puzzle pieces"" have been out there, and if you put them together, you could have positioned ahead of the news. MP was one i mentioned in my previous post but there have been others.

To get to the point... There is an ""AI Action Day"" event happening on Wednesday. Hosted by All-In podcast people (David Sachs) and with various tech leaders in attendance as well as Trump of course.  Supposedly this will be an announcement of a larger strategy to promote US AI dominance. I would bet that there are opportunities here. Not clear if there is a home run, but I think a smart person could figure out a smart way to play this.

Unfortunately, I'm not a smart person, but maybe collectively as a group of not-smart people, we can figure out some plays here.

I can't link sources for some reason, keeps deleting my post, but you guys can google more information regarding the event if you want. TLDR It's being hosted

Technology leaders participating in the event include **Chris Power, CEO of Hadrian**; **Shyam Sankar, CTO of Palantir**; **Paul Buchheit, Partner at YCombinator; James Litinsky, CEO of MP Materials; Lisa Su, CEO of AMD.**

Additional speakers are still being confirmed.

I don't think the obvious choices are going to move much here. NVDA is already up significantly and i don't expect any announcements big enough to move a 4 trillion market cap... The easing of chip restrictions is also already priced in now. I expected this will be touched on at the event, but it's no longer news.

Spitballing but a few ideas:

I think energy will be a major focus of any strategy announcement. This is an area that is critically important for AI, and an area where the US is SIGNIFICANTLY lagging China. I'm not too sure how this could be played, but I'm considering EQT. I was looking at them last week due to the PA AI event.

I'm really just spitballing and hoping to start some conversation here. || AI Action Day This Wednesday I posted a couple days ago expressing my view that money can be made by being on top of trump's agenda, policy-related news, etc. I'm not saying its easy, but I think in several instances so far this year, the ""puzzle pieces"" have been out there, and if you put them together, you could have positioned ahead of the news. MP was one i mentioned in my previous post but there have been others.

To get to the point... There is an ""AI Action Day"" event happening on Wednesday. Hosted by All-In podcast people (David Sachs) and with various tech leaders in attendance as well as Trump of course.  Supposedly this will be an announcement of a larger strategy to promote US AI dominance. I would bet that there are opportunities here. Not clear if there is a home run, but I think a smart person could figure out a smart way to play this.

Unfortunately, I'm not a smart person, but maybe collectively as a group of not-smart people, we can figure out some plays here.

I can't link sources for some reason, keeps deleting my post, but you guys can google more information regarding the event if you want. TLDR It's being hosted

Technology leaders participating in the event include **Chris Power, CEO of Hadrian**; **Shyam Sankar, CTO of Palantir**; **Paul Buchheit, Partner at YCombinator; James Litinsky, CEO of MP Materials; Lisa Su, CEO of AMD.**

Additional speakers are still being confirmed.

I don't think the obvious choices are going to move much here. NVDA is already up significantly and i don't expect any announcements big enough to move a 4 trillion market cap... The easing of chip restrictions is also already priced in now. I expected this will be touched on at the event, but it's no longer news.

Spitballing but a few ideas:

I think energy will be a major focus of any strategy announcement. This is an area that is critically important for AI, and an area where the US is SIGNIFICANTLY lagging China. I'm not too sure how this could be played, but I'm considering EQT. I was looking at them last week due to the PA AI event. The stock didn't move much unfortunately, but all of nat gas seems to have struggled to close the week for whatever reason. By no means an expert here, but EQT has a major grift angle in that their CEO is closely tied to the republican party/trump.

Most battery tech journalism is frustrating because you will hear constant tales of a tech that will double or triple battery capacity, and then of course the change never happens. The reason for this is multi-faceted:

1) what works in a lab often doesn't work in real world conditions,
2) battery materials are like two faced super-models they can be absolutely perfect when looking at one metric, but can have debilitating shortcomings when looking at another, and

3) most of the time you need to see 100 different success stories in parallel to make a dramatic change happen, and the article speaks of the 1 improvement only and speaks as if the other 99 problems have already been solved.

If you're going to see a new type of battery that has the potential not to just dominate current markets, but to create entirely new markets for electrification; a convergence of multiple incredibly difficult to master technologies would need to happen in parallel. And there would need to be enabling tech that would allow each subcomponent to cover the flaws of the other so that in the aggregate you have a well-rounded battery that can dominate.

This type of battery is still a dream, anything more than a whisper and it can vanish. But for those of you who dare to dream with me, let me whisper away and explain what I might be seeing in the industry and how Enovix might play the crucial role in bringing it all together‚Ä¶

*Not financial advice, but if I were giving financial advice, I would advise you to assess ENVX based on the AI-1 battery and your assumptions as to market share, manufacturing, and margins that it can take in the  Consumer electronics space in the coming years.

So what type of potential battery am I talking about? A solid-state (sulfide based), sulfur cathode battery, with a pre-lithiated si anode. This type of battery would be sourced from cheap, scalable, and abundant materials with an energy density that could potentially enable regional flight or trans-pacific cargo shipping. But every step in that chain has immense hurdles to overcome before you can  get there. Let's evaluate the potential and the hurdles one by one, and let's see how it fits into the Enovix tech stack.

Let's start first with our baby, Enovix. I won't go deep into the details because my followers already know the story well. Enovix is not a Si battery company, it's a novel battery architecture, that has properties that enable it to use non-traditional battery materials. One such property is its ability to handle electrodes that swell. Electrodes that swell are the best kind, they swell because they are storing so much lithium they form a new alloy and balloon up in size. Intercalating (traditional) battery materials on the other hand can only store a little bit of lithium because they store the lithium between layers, like a bookshelf holding books.

So if you can build a battery mechanically designed to handle swelling, you've invented a new class of batteries. You've invented conversion class batteries.

But how does Enovix do this? Through a very simple trick in physics. Force=Pressure*Area. Enovix laser dices its electrodes and then stands them on their thin edge and stacks those thin edge standing electrodes for the width of their cell. What that has done is re-oriented the large face of the electrodes to the sides of the battery and not to the top of the battery. If using conversion style electrodes that swell, the larger part of the elctrodes are facing the small face of the battery (the side)  and not the large one. So again, F=P*A and what you've just done is dramatically reduced the A in the equation. That means you can dramatically reduce the F required in the equation to achieve a P that can constrain the urge to swell. Indeed, because of the orthogonal stacking, Enovix can easily add 10 Megapascals of stack pressure to the solid electrodes (the liquid electrolyte is under normal pressure) with a tiny constraint system. Typical prismatic cells have stack pressure around 0.1 Mpa maybe to up to 1 Mpa.

And then as a bonus, the shape of these electrodes stood on their thin edge provides easy access to pre-lithiate si anodes.

And then as an even better bonus the orientation just happens to be perfectly shaped like a heat exchanger. Having all of these strips of electrodes oriented this way allows uniform and very close access to cooling. We're talking 33x more efficient cooling. You can get the heat out of the center of the cell uniformly with ease.

There are other advantages, but for the rest of this discussion, Enovix's ability to provide stack pressure and its ability to provide extreme thermal control are going to be the two properties of the architecture that enable the rest of the magic I will soon discuss.


The next element of that super battery I need to discuss is the solid state element. ""Solid state is the holy grail of battery development"" is a common refrain. That's mostly marketing (inside joke for me), but solid state does have some extreme advantages.

Upsides:
1) Imagine picking up two bags of sand. One is wet and one is dry. Which one is lighter? A lot lighter

2) Because the electrolyte layer IS the separator, you get rid of the inactive separator. You also get rid of other inactive components that don't need to be there if there is no liquid electrolyte.

3) Often conflated with solid state tech is actually just anode side improvements. Solid state often works better with pure lithium metal on the anode side than can be done with liquid electrolytes; in a liquid electrolyte you have a more unstable SEI layer and in solid state you can have a stronger anode electrolyte      interface which can enable pure lithium metal anodes. That translates to serious gains for the whole system similar to what enovix sees by making massive anode side improvements using si. *I'm still skeptical on lithium metal working in the real world. It always will work in the lab, but lithium metal exists nowhere in nature as li metal because its too reactive.

4) No flammable electrolyte reduces fire hazard.

Downsides:
A battery is just a reversible chemistry reaction where negative electrons (electricity) flow in and out and positive ions (lithium in this case) flow back and forth between two electrodes. The flow of those positive ions is easier to facilitate in a liquid vs in a solid. But serious progress has been made using solids.

Ionic conductivity: this is the challenge of moving positive ions around. Surprisingly, sulfide based      electrolyte layers are getting so good that their Siemens per centimeter (how much resistance to moving ions) is approaching that and sometimes      exceeding liquid electrolytes. Quite frankly, this is miracle number 1 in the whole chain. The better the ionic conductivity, the thinner the electrolyte gets to be and just like regular separators thinner is better both for volume and for weight and for cost. Sulfide solid state has a clear advantage over oxide/ceramic based ones that have to be thicker both for ionic conductivity reasons and for brittleness reasons.

Interfacial Connection: think  of a relay race. The ionic conductivity is how fast the runners can run but the interface between the cathode->solid electrolyte->anode is like the baton exchange in a relay race. This is where SSB's tend to struggle. But it turns out, with sulfide based electrolyte layers high stack pressure can greatly improve the interfacial connection allowing for  a uniform and seamless connection between the layers of battery. (*hint, Enovix architecture easily provides stack pressure).

Hot spots and heat transfer issues. The liquid electrolyte doesn't just transfer the ions effectively,      it also transfer heat around the cell, bringing it to the edge of the cell where it can cooled. Without that liquid electrolyte, even though its less flammable, those hot spots will kill cycle life and cause degradation issues if not dealt with. *If only there were a perfect architecture for thermal control.

Dendrites in a lithium metal anode. Sulfide based SSB are considered more prone to dendrites than oxide      based SSB's. This is likely why NIO, makes their semi-solid state battery based on a sulfide layer with a prelithiated Si-C mix on the anode side rather than the lithium metal side. (I wonder who else can do that anode side trick‚Ä¶.but at a much higher % of Si-C?)

Moisture sensitivity: sulfides are extremely sensitive to moisture and current manufacturers like Toyota have worked to use additives and coatings that make it less      so.

Manufacturability: Can you make the electrolyte? Once you've made that, can you then use it when      manufacturing the cell itself? Sulfide based electrolytes are extremely sensitive to moisture and oxygen, and using them to make a cell would likely require at least some of the steps to be done in a pure argon or a pure nitrogen environment, which means lights off automation would be required for those steps.

I don't want to understate the challenge here. Being able to allow ion transfer in a solid electrolyte is incredibly challenging to make happen in a cell, and incredibly difficult to manufacture in a scalable process. But there are at least two companies (Nio and Cherry) already taking this trick to production ready cells in China, and companies like Toyota/Samsung/Solid Power all have made incredible progress. Sulfide based SSB's are clearly stepping out of the proof of concept stage and starting to be ready for the next level. If you add in an architecture that easily adds stack pressure and thermal control, you might be on to something‚Ä¶

$ENVX

We've now made it to the cathode side of this super battery equation. Sulfur based cathodes. Unlike every single other battery cathode on the marketplace today that is intercalating, sulfur is a conversion style cathode. That means it forms an alloy with the lithium and can store much Much MUCH more lithium than anything else on the market. It's also incredibly abundant, cheap, and light.

So why the hell are you just hearing about it now? Did an anon on Twitter discover this wonder battery material under everyone's nose? Of course not. Sulfur is the definition of the two-faced supermodel. It's amazing in some respects, and atrocious in other respects. If you can find a way to cover its weaknesses, you have a potential super battery.

What are those weaknesses? First and foremost you have serious cycle life issues resulting from ""polysulfide shuttling."" Lithium sulfur undergoes multiple reactions when it takes in and then releases lithium and in this process tiny ""polysulfides"" can escape to the anode side and this absolutely wrecks any hope of cycle life you had with the battery. Current lithium sulfur cathode makers are trying to mitigate this by using various carbon products to trap the polysulfides before they shuttle away.

But it turns out there is a much more effective way to contain the number 1 problem of polysulfide shuttling. The solution is to pair sulfur based cathodes with sulfide based solid state electrolytes. This 100% filters out any polysulfides shutting all the way to the anode. 100%. Now there likely still is some impact from cathode side only polysulfide shuttling, but we're talking 95% of the problem is solved for you if you can pair sulfur cathode with sulfide electrolyte.

So once again, did I, an anon on twitter just discover this amazing trick that has eluded battery chemists for decades? Of course not. As a conversion style cathode, Sulfur expands and contracts by up to 80% of its volume in charge and discharge. This means that the number one unsolved problem for SSB's, that of interfacial contact between the layers, becomes virtually impossible to do with sulfur based cathodes making the point moot. 

But what if you have a battery architecture that can easily add in extremely high stack pressure in such a way that the expansion is controlled. The interface between the particles even in a sulfur cathode are perfectly uniform and perfectly in contact with a sulfide based electrolyte? That's exactly what Enovix can do. 

But sulfur's amazing potential isn't purely held back by polysulfide shuttling. It also is known for very low power output. We're talking 0.1 C power output (weak sauce), when the batteries required for drones are going to need to be on the order of 10C. This is where the work of the cathode manufacturers pairing it with new types of easily made carbon are making massive amounts of progress. Multiple companies and universities are now testing lithium sulfur based cathodes that are both high capacity and high power now, unheard of only a few years ago.

The next downside to sulfur unfortunately is volumetric density. Gravimetrically it is untouchable. Volumetrically it is weak. Cathode makers have to use low sulfur loading to increase its power output and also a lot of binder to glue it together during its expansion and contraction. In addition, they try to space it out pretty far apart to allow for said expansion and contraction. Once again, the Enovix high stack pressure can make a dramatic difference here. It can greatly reduce the amount of binder required, and the mechanical system is designed for the stuff to be packed in tight, because it is a conversion class battery designed to handle the swell.

The final problem I will discuss is one of heat. All Enovix investors know, the secret to extreme fast charge is rapid and uniform heat extraction from the center of the cell during charging. Fast charge brings in a ton of resistive heating related to bringing all that power in at once. But lesser known, is the fact that most intercalating cathode materials have a slightly endothermic reaction when the cathode gives up the lithium during charging. This means the chemical reaction that occurs during charging of say an LCO cathode, actually reduces the heat in the cell not adds to it. But sulfur is different. When it gives up the lithium, that multi stage reaction is exothermic at every stage. Meaning, if you want to fast charge you now have to get the resistive heat (resistive heat is why a toaster gets hot) out as well as the heat from the chemical reaction itself. And to add pain to this equation, if you're doing all of this in a solid state battery, you don't have a liquid that can rapidly transfer the heat from the center of the cell to the edge. If you don't have a battery form factor/architecture specifically designed for rapid heat extraction, you are going to create hotspots that kill the cycle life of your battery.

Hopefully now you are starting to see why having a battery that can provide high stack pressure and extreme thermal control is not just a nice to have, but is absolutely crucial to making this type of battery work.

$ENVX

We're now to the anode side. I won't belabor this point because everyone knows this is already where Enovix shines. It takes 100% Si-C, prelithiates it, and then uses that anode side advantage in conjunction with regular LCO on the cathode to create the AI-1 battery that is about to take the high margin consumer electronics space by storm.

I will reiterate, that the knock on sulfide based solid state electrolyte is that it is more prone to dendrite formation when compared with oxide based SSB. So while sulfides are basically twice as ionically conductive allowing it to be much thinner (both lighter and more volumetrically dense), it may not be as reliable when using lithium metal. Well, the very easy solution to this is to use si on the anode side, especially if you're partnering with a si anode expert.

BTW, NIO currently makes semi-solid state batteries (using traditional cathode materials and retaining half the liquid weight because its only semi solid state), and they use si on the anode side presumably for this exact reason. In real world conditions, the only route to get to extremely high cycle life for this type of battery is si on the anode side not li metal imho.

$ENVX

Let me summarize. There is a whisper of a dream for a potential battery that would not just be an upgrade to existing batteries, it would be a world changing technology that future historians would list alongside the invention of the steam engine. But in order to achieve this multiple miracles from an entire ecosystem of companies and universities would have to happen in parallel and the subcomponents all have to work in concert to hide each other's weaknesses.

But, in theory.....

1) The main weakness of the  sulfur based cathode (polysulfide shuttling) can be solved by using a      sulfide based SSB

2) The main weakness of a SSB, especially when paired with an expanding and contracting sulfur based      cathode (interfacial connectivity), can be solved by high stack pressure easily achieved using Enovix architecture.

3) The second main weakness for sulfur based cathodes of volumetric density, can be dramatically improved by the high stack pressure easily achieved using Enovix Architecture.

4) The serious problem of dendrite formation from a sulfide based SSB can be solved using pre lithiated si on the anode side rather than li metal, a technique Enovix has already perfected.

5) The serious problems regarding heat extraction and thermal control that would come from a sulfur based cathode having exothermic reactions during charging, and made  worse by an all solid battery without the liquid electrolyte to transfer heat around, would have to be solved by a battery architecture that      specifically enables rapid and uniform heat extraction.

All of this would have to be manufactured by teams of experts capable of manufacturing in extreme      environments. Microchip manufacturers do that every day.

Other problems like power output for sulfur based cathodes or ionic conductivity for sulfide based solid electrolytes are immensely challenging, but appear to be being solved by multiple companies as we speak. Enovix potentially can serve as the architecture and partner that enables it all. 

Now the beauty of this whole thing is, it's not a zero to 1 proposition for Enovix. As we speak, Enovix is about to capitalize on being able to produce batteries with JUST the anode side of this equation. The AI-1 battery that is north of 900 Wh/L, has a 3C charge rate, high cycle life, and AI enabling power output is the result of only one side of this equation paired with an LCO cathode. And after that, if they're challenged they'll implement a higher voltage cathode (likely specially coated LCO) to continue their dominance. But in the background, they can be working on bringing together the next gen battery ecosystem required to make this much bigger dream happen. Maybe the next step is just the SSB side. And then the final step would be the sulfur cathode paired with it all. This is all wildly speculative, but extremely exciting. It should at least be known that these potential tech tree combinations appear to be coming together. 

Enovix, come for smartphone opportunity, stay for the chance to change the world. Good luck out there. || $ENVX Enovix Corp undertaking transformative battery tech DD on $ENVX Enovix Batteries Corp (posted on behalf of 2percentisfair on X)

Moisture sensitivity: sulfides are extremely sensitive to moisture and current manufacturers like Toyota have worked to use additives and coatings that make it less      so.

Manufacturability: Can you make the electrolyte? Once you've made that, can you then use it when      manufacturing the cell itself? Sulfide based electrolytes are extremely sensitive to moisture and oxygen, and using them to make a cell would likely require at least some of the steps to be done in a pure argon or a pure nitrogen environment, which means lights off automation would be required for those steps.

I don't want to understate the challenge here. Being able to allow ion transfer in a solid electrolyte is incredibly challenging to make happen in a cell, and incredibly difficult to manufacture in a scalable process. But there are at least two companies (Nio and Cherry) already taking this trick to production ready cells in China, and companies like Toyota/Samsung/Solid Power all have made incredible progress. Sulfide based SSB's are clearly stepping out of the proof of concept stage and starting to be ready for the next level. If you add in an architecture that easily adds stack pressure and thermal control, you might be on to something‚Ä¶

We've now made it to the cathode side of this super battery equation. Sulfur based cathodes. Unlike every single other battery cathode on the marketplace today that is intercalating, sulfur is a conversion style cathode. That means it forms an alloy with the lithium and can store much Much MUCH more lithium than anything else on the market. It's also incredibly abundant, cheap, and light.

So why the hell are you just hearing about it now? Did an anon on Twitter discover this wonder battery material under everyone's nose? Of course not. Sulfur is the definition of the two-faced supermodel. It's amazing in some respects, and atrocious in other respects. If you can find a way to cover its weaknesses, you have a potential super battery.

What are those weaknesses? First and foremost you have serious cycle life issues resulting from ""polysulfide shuttling."" Lithium sulfur undergoes multiple reactions when it takes in and then releases lithium and in this process tiny ""polysulfides"" can escape to the anode side and this absolutely wrecks any hope of cycle life you had with the battery. Current lithium sulfur cathode makers are trying to mitigate this by using various carbon products to trap the polysulfides before they shuttle away.

But it turns out there is a much more effective way to contain the number 1 problem of polysulfide shuttling. The solution is to pair sulfur based cathodes with sulfide based solid state electrolytes. This 100% filters out any polysulfides shutting all the way to the anode. 100%. Now there likely still is some impact from cathode side only polysulfide shuttling, but we're talking 95% of the problem is solved for you if you can pair sulfur cathode with sulfide electrolyte.

So once again, did I, an anon on twitter just discover this amazing trick that has eluded battery chemists for decades? Of course not. As a conversion style cathode, Sulfur expands and contracts by up to 80% of its volume in charge and discharge. This means that the number one unsolved problem for SSB's, that of interfacial contact between the layers, becomes virtually impossible to do with sulfur based cathodes making the point moot. 

But what if you have a battery architecture that can easily add in extremely high stack pressure in such a way that the expansion is controlled. The interface between the particles even in a sulfur cathode are perfectly uniform and perfectly in contact with a sulfide based electrolyte? That's exactly what Enovix can do. 

But sulfur's amazing potential isn't purely held back by polysulfide shuttling. It also is known for very low power output. We're talking 0.1 C power output (weak sauce), when the batteries required for drones are going to need to be on the order of 10C. This is where the work of the cathode manufacturers pairing it with new types of easily made carbon are making massive amounts of progress. Multiple companies and universities are now testing lithium sulfur based cathodes that are both high capacity and high power now, unheard of only a few years ago.

The next downside to sulfur unfortunately is volumetric density. Gravimetrically it is untouchable. Volumetrically it is weak. Cathode makers have to use low sulfur loading to increase its power output and also a lot of binder to glue it together during its expansion and contraction. In addition, they try to space it out pretty far apart to allow for said expansion and contraction. Once again, the Enovix high stack pressure can make a dramatic difference here. It can greatly reduce the amount of binder required, and the mechanical system is designed for the stuff to be packed in tight, because it is a conversion class battery designed to handle the swell.

The final problem I will discuss is one of heat. All Enovix investors know, the secret to extreme fast charge is rapid and uniform heat extraction from the center of the cell during charging. Fast charge brings in a ton of resistive heating related to bringing all that power in at once. But lesser known, is the fact that most intercalating cathode materials have a slightly endothermic reaction when the cathode gives up the lithium during charging. This means the chemical reaction that occurs during charging of say an LCO cathode, actually reduces the heat in the cell not adds to it. But sulfur is different. When it gives up the lithium, that multi stage reaction is exothermic at every stage. Meaning, if you want to fast charge you now have to get the resistive heat (resistive heat is why a toaster gets hot) out as well as the heat from the chemical reaction itself. And to add pain to this equation, if you're doing all of this in a solid state battery, you don't have a liquid that can rapidly transfer the heat from the center of the cell to the edge. If you don't have a battery form factor/architecture specifically designed for rapid heat extraction, you are going to create hotspots that kill the cycle life of your battery.

Hopefully now you are starting to see why having a battery that can provide high stack pressure and extreme thermal control is not just a nice to have, but is absolutely crucial to making this type of battery work.

$ENVX

We're now to the anode side. I won't belabor this point because everyone knows this is already where Enovix shines. It takes 100% Si-C, prelithiates it, and then uses that anode side advantage in conjunction with regular LCO on the cathode to create the AI-1 battery that is about to take the high margin consumer electronics space by storm.

I will reiterate, that the knock on sulfide based solid state electrolyte is that it is more prone to dendrite formation when compared with oxide based SSB. So while sulfides are basically twice as ionically conductive allowing it to be much thinner (both lighter and more volumetrically dense), it may not be as reliable when using lithium metal. Well, the very easy solution to this is to use si on the anode side, especially if you're partnering with a si anode expert.

BTW, NIO currently makes semi-solid state batteries (using traditional cathode materials and retaining half the liquid weight because its only semi solid state), and they use si on the anode side presumably for this exact reason. In real world conditions, the only route to get to extremely high cycle life for this type of battery is si on the anode side not li metal imho.

$ENVX

Let me summarize. There is a whisper of a dream for a potential battery that would not just be an upgrade to existing batteries, it would be a world changing technology that future historians would list alongside the invention of the steam engine. But in order to achieve this multiple miracles from an entire ecosystem of companies and universities would have to happen in parallel and the subcomponents all have to work in concert to hide each other's weaknesses.

But, in theory.....

1) The main weakness of the  sulfur based cathode (polysulfide shuttling) can be solved by using a      sulfide based SSB

2) The main weakness of a SSB, especially when paired with an expanding and contracting sulfur based      cathode (interfacial connectivity), can be solved by high stack pressure easily achieved using Enovix architecture.

3) The second main weakness for sulfur based cathodes of volumetric density, can be dramatically improved by the high stack pressure easily achieved using Enovix Architecture.

4) The serious problem of dendrite formation from a sulfide based SSB can be solved using pre lithiated si on the anode side rather than li metal, a technique Enovix has already perfected.

5) The serious problems regarding heat extraction and thermal control that would come from a sulfur based cathode having exothermic reactions during charging, and made  worse by an all solid battery without the liquid electrolyte to transfer heat around, would have to be solved by a battery architecture that      specifically enables rapid and uniform heat extraction.

All of this would have to be manufactured by teams of experts capable of manufacturing in extreme      environments. Microchip manufacturers do that every day.

Other problems like power output for sulfur based cathodes or ionic conductivity for sulfide based solid electrolytes are immensely challenging, but appear to be being solved by multiple companies as we speak. Enovix potentially can serve as the architecture and partner that enables it all. 

Now the beauty of this whole thing is, it's not a zero to 1 proposition for Enovix. As we speak, Enovix is about to capitalize on being able to produce batteries with JUST the anode side of this equation. The AI-1 battery that is north of 900 Wh/L, has a 3C charge rate, high cycle life, and AI enabling power output is the result of only one side of this equation paired with an LCO cathode. And after that, if they're challenged they'll implement a higher voltage cathode (likely specially coated LCO) to continue their dominance. But in the background, they can be working on bringing together the next gen battery ecosystem required to make this much bigger dream happen. Maybe the next step is just the SSB side. And then the final step would be the sulfur cathode paired with it all. This is all wildly speculative, but extremely exciting. It should at least be known that these potential tech tree combinations appear to be coming together.

We can use DASH and FAST-41 to our advantage to help us make investment choices as this run extends across the industry. I expect further DoD funding to trickle in within the next few weeks.

In April, T[rump initiated a Section 232 investigation into the national security threat that critical minerals pose](https://www.whitehouse.gov/fact-sheets/2025/04/fact-sheet-president-donald-j-trump-ensures-national-security-and-economic-resilience-through-section-232-actions-on-processed-critical-minerals-and-derivative-products/).¬†[Likewise as with Copper,](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trump-announces-50-tariff-copper-effective-august-1-2025-07-10/)¬†and as we have seen with Graphite just yesterday (linked above), we are likely to see tariffs roll out on further minerals by way of this investigation. After the report is completed, Trump will have a short amount of time to decide whether to impose tariffs or not on the industry.

Which minerals, though? Theoretically, most of them, as they all are strategic to defense. However, our production capacity is not high for certain areas yet (e.g. heavy rare earths), so what will happen exactly is not known to me entirely.

That being said, we know that the administration is not afraid of stepping up to China boldly, nor are they afraid of import controls and tariffs. This is an area to watch carefully. I expect announcements in the next weeks to months, if not sooner.

Lithium in particular stands out to me. Chinese price-gouging of the spot price has made it almost impossible for domestic producers to be able to compete. Take that information as you wish!

Love,  
Steve || Understanding Your Next Play in Critical Minerals (DD) Hi all,

I wanted to touch base to tell you all about how I‚Äôve been considering new fund allocations across the sector, especially given that we have begun to see sizable upside. I also wanted to point out a potential catalyst across the industry broadly, but especially for particular minerals and rare earths.

**I. DASH, FAST-41, and YOU, a primer**

The federal government has a initiative called the **Defense Authorization for Strategic and High‚ÄëTech.**¬†Speaking in terms of minerals initiative‚Äîit presents as an¬†**investment/funding program**¬†linked to the DoD (and also relevant to DPA, DOE) aimed at accelerating U.S. supply chains in critical minerals (like graphite, rare earths, etc.). It focuses on¬†**grants, offtake agreements, and financial backing.**¬†They also have a dashboard called FAST-41. This is primarily for permitting and regulatory approvals related to infrastructure, including mining and critical minerals.

As we have seen with¬†[the recent MP <-> Pentagon deal](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/07/10/pentagon-to-become-largest-shareholder-in-rare-earth-magnet-maker-mp-materials.html), the US government isn‚Äôt joking around about providing significant backing to promising rare earth and critical minerals companies that process, mine, and develop product domestically. They have¬†[outright said it themselves](https://www.reuters.com/world/china/pentagon-keep-working-with-us-rare-earths-projects-us-defense-official-says-2025-07-15/)¬†\- they are aiming to provide more funding, and fast.

We can use DASH and FAST-41 to our advantage to help us make investment choices as this run extends across the industry. I expect further DoD funding to trickle in within the next few weeks. Here are some compelling contenders for federal funding and incentivization, analyzed by their relationship with the federal government (existing contracts, speculation, FAST designation, or beyond).

>**UCORE Rare Metals (UURAF)**: Strategically placed with exposure to both US and Canadian government investments, this company has compelling technology for the separation of Heavy Rare Earths.¬†[They have recently been awarded a DoD grant](https://ucore.com/ucore-launches-us-department-of-defense-funded-18-4-million-commercial-rare-earth-refining-project/).

>**Energy Fuels (UUUU)**: As both a uranium producer and a producer of rare earth oxides¬†[(most recently announcing heavy rare earth oxide production)](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/energy-fuels-now-producing-heavy-104500195.html), this company is well-poised for significant government investment.

>**American Battery Technology (ABAT)**: Leading in battery recycling, this company has relationships with big names like TESLA and ties to federal funds.

>**Graphite One (GPHOF):**¬†This company has the potential to be come a vertically integrated graphite source. China‚Äôs grip over graphite processing is equally as dominant as their grip over rare earth processing.

>**WestWater Resources (WWR):**¬†Also a graphite producer, this company is well-poised for support from Washington.¬†[Recently, the administration announced import tariffs on graphite anode from China.](https://www.reuters.com/world/china/us-commerce-dept-sets-935-anti-dumping-tariff-chinese-anode-graphite-2025-07-17/#:~:text=July%2017%20(Reuters)%20%2D%20The,less%20than%20fair%20market%20value.)¬†That‚Äôs big news.

>**Lithium Americas (LAC):**¬†North America‚Äôs largest lithium deposit with big name partnerships¬†[(e.g. GM invested $650 million dollars into it](https://lithiumamericas.com/news/news-details/2024/Unlocking-Thacker-Pass-General-Motors-to-Contribute-Combined-625-Million-in-Cash-and-Letters-of-Credit-to-New-Joint-Venture-with-Lithium-Americas/default.aspx)). This one is as obvious a play as I have ever seen.

>**The Metals Company (TMC):**¬†High risk, high reward. They are awaiting permitting news in the next few months. Unprecedented plan to retrieve minerals from the ocean floor.

I also continue to believe in further upside at¬†**MP materials,**¬†despite their already magnificent run and news.

**II. Import Tariffs via Section 232**

In April, T[rump initiated a Section 232 investigation into the national security threat that critical minerals pose](https://www.whitehouse.gov/fact-sheets/2025/04/fact-sheet-president-donald-j-trump-ensures-national-security-and-economic-resilience-through-section-232-actions-on-processed-critical-minerals-and-derivative-products/).¬†[Likewise as with Copper,](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trump-announces-50-tariff-copper-effective-august-1-2025-07-10/)¬†and as we have seen with Graphite just yesterday (linked above), we are likely to see tariffs roll out on further minerals by way of this investigation. After the report is completed, Trump will have a short amount of time to decide whether to impose tariffs or not on the industry.

Which minerals, though? Theoretically, most of them, as they all are strategic to defense. However, our production capacity is not high for certain areas yet (e.g. heavy rare earths), so what will happen exactly is not known to me entirely.

That being said, we know that the administration is not afraid of stepping up to China boldly, nor are they afraid of import controls and tariffs. This is an area to watch carefully. I expect announcements in the next weeks to months, if not sooner.

Lithium in particular stands out to me. Chinese price-gouging of the spot price has made it almost impossible for domestic producers to be able to compete. Take that information as you wish!

That‚Äôs all for now folks.

## New Products: Chime+ and Chime Workplace

On March 31, 2025, Chime launched two game-changing updates:

- **Chime+ Premium Membership** (free with qualifying direct deposits):
  - 3.75% APY on savings (vs. 0.45% national average).
  - Custom cashback deals with top retailers, boosting transaction volume.
  - Priority customer support for faster issue resolution.
  - Enhances user engagement and retention. [Source: Chime Newsroom](https://www.chime.com/newsroom/news/chime-launches-premium-membership-tier-and-more-than-a-dozen-new-features-in-redesigned-app/)

- **Chime Workplace**: A financial wellness suite for employers, offering tools to improve employee financial health. With two-thirds of workers seeking such benefits, this B2B play diversifies revenue beyond consumer banking.

These launches, part of a redesigned app with features like FICO score tracking and credit building, strengthen Chime‚Äôs ecosystem.

---

## MyPay: Disrupting Predatory Lending

Chime‚Äôs MyPay offers $20-$500 paycheck advances with no interest or mandatory fees ($2 for instant access). Compare to:

- Payday loans: Up to 652% interest.
- Credit card advances: 17.99%-29.99% interest.

Targeting fee-sensitive users, MyPay drives loyalty and interchange revenue, disrupting predatory lenders and locking in users for long-term growth.

---

## Business Model: Scalable and Defensible

Chime‚Äôs lean model gives it an edge:

- **No Physical Branches**: Lower overhead vs. traditional banks.
- **Higher Interchange Fees**: Non-bank status avoids regulatory caps.
- **No Credit Risk**: FDIC bank partnerships (e.g., The Bancorp, Stride Bank) eliminate loan losses.
- **Sticky Users**: Direct deposit makes Chime the default bank for 67% of users.

Competitors like SoFi, PayPal, and Square are strong, but Chime‚Äôs focus on the underbanked and no-fee model sets it apart.

---

## ChimeCore Catalyst: In-House Processing

Chime is transitioning from Galileo Financial Technologies (SoFi-owned, acquired for $1.2B in 2020) to its own processor, **ChimeCore**. By end-2024, credit card transactions moved to ChimeCore, with debit cards likely transitioning by mid-2025. Benefits include:

- **Cost Savings**: Cutting Galileo‚Äôs fees could add millions to the bottom line.
- **Operational Control**: Reduces reliance on SoFi and mitigates outage risks (e.g., Galileo‚Äôs 2019 issues).
- **Market Impact**: Analysts estimate a 20%+ stock pop on completion. [Source: Chime S1 Filing](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1795586/000162828025025059/chimefinancialinc-sx1wq1da.htm)

Execution risks (technical delays, integration costs) exist, but margin expansion potential is significant.

## Analyst Sentiment: Bullish Outlook

Analysts are optimistic, with 13 ‚ÄúBuy‚Äù ratings and a $37.75 average price target (~6% upside from $35.60):

| Analyst            | Rating       | Price Target |
|--------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Evercore ISI       | Outperform   | $38          |
| William Blair      | Outperform   | -            |
| Piper Sandler      | Overweight   | $40          |
| Morgan Stanley     | Bullish      | -            |

This reflects Chime‚Äôs strong product-market fit and growth potential. [Source: StockAnalysis](https://stockanalysis.com/stocks/chym/forecast/)

---

## Options Flow: Bullish Bets

- Heavy volume in $40 calls (30% upside from $35.60) signals institutional interest.
- High volatility (beta 4.79) makes it a WSB-friendly play.
- August 7 earnings could spark a move if Chime beats and raises guidance.

---

## Bull Case: Why This Could Pop

- **Massive TAM**: <5% penetration, 95% growth runway in a 227M market.
- **Profitable Growth**: 32% revenue growth, Q1 2025 profitability.
- **Innovation**: Chime+ and Chime Workplace drive engagement and new revenue.
- **Catalysts**: August earnings, ChimeCore transition, upmarket expansion.
- **Valuation**: Below IPO high ($43), with analyst targets suggesting upside.

---

## Risks to Consider

- **Economic Sensitivity**: Low-income users may cut spending in a downturn.
- **Competition**: SoFi, PayPal, Square, and adapting banks pose threats.
- **Regulatory Risk**: Potential fee caps could hit interchange revenue.
- **Valuation**: Rich at $11.09B with no P/E (TTM EPS -$0.43).

## Positions

- 500 shares
- 10 Aug $40 calls

## Verdict

Chime‚Äôs a fintech leader with a massive market, strong growth, and catalysts like ChimeCore and new products. Analyst support and options flow point to upside, especially post-earnings.

GM,2025-07-18,US,"Understanding Your Next Play in Critical Minerals (DD) Hi all,

I wanted to touch base to tell you all about how I‚Äôve been considering new fund allocations across the sector, especially given that we have begun to see sizable upside. I also wanted to point out a potential catalyst across the industry broadly, but especially for particular minerals and rare earths.

**I. DASH, FAST-41, and YOU, a primer**

The federal government has a initiative called the **Defense Authorization for Strategic and High‚ÄëTech.**¬†Speaking in terms of minerals initiative‚Äîit presents as an¬†**investment/funding program**¬†linked to the DoD (and also relevant to DPA, DOE) aimed at accelerating U.S. supply chains in critical minerals (like graphite, rare earths, etc.). It focuses on¬†**grants, offtake agreements, and financial backing.**¬†They also have a dashboard called FAST-41. This is primarily for permitting and regulatory approvals related to infrastructure, including mining and critical minerals.

As we have seen with¬†[the recent MP <-> Pentagon deal](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/07/10/pentagon-to-become-largest-shareholder-in-rare-earth-magnet-maker-mp-materials.html), the US government isn‚Äôt joking around about providing significant backing to promising rare earth and critical minerals companies that process, mine, and develop product domestically. They have¬†[outright said it themselves](https://www.reuters.com/world/china/pentagon-keep-working-with-us-rare-earths-projects-us-defense-official-says-2025-07-15/)¬†\- they are aiming to provide more funding, and fast.

We can use DASH and FAST-41 to our advantage to help us make investment choices as this run extends across the industry. I expect further DoD funding to trickle in within the next few weeks. Here are some compelling contenders for federal funding and incentivization, analyzed by their relationship with the federal government (existing contracts, speculation, FAST designation, or beyond).

>**UCORE Rare Metals (UURAF)**: Strategically placed with exposure to both US and Canadian government investments, this company has compelling technology for the separation of Heavy Rare Earths.¬†[They have recently been awarded a DoD grant](https://ucore.com/ucore-launches-us-department-of-defense-funded-18-4-million-commercial-rare-earth-refining-project/).

>**Energy Fuels (UUUU)**: As both a uranium producer and a producer of rare earth oxides¬†[(most recently announcing heavy rare earth oxide production)](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/energy-fuels-now-producing-heavy-104500195.html), this company is well-poised for significant government investment.

>**American Battery Technology (ABAT)**: Leading in battery recycling, this company has relationships with big names like TESLA and ties to federal funds.

>**Graphite One (GPHOF):**¬†This company has the potential to be come a vertically integrated graphite source. China‚Äôs grip over graphite processing is equally as dominant as their grip over rare earth processing.

>**WestWater Resources (WWR):**¬†Also a graphite producer, this company is well-poised for support from Washington.¬†[Recently, the administration announced import tariffs on graphite anode from China.](https://www.reuters.com/world/china/us-commerce-dept-sets-935-anti-dumping-tariff-chinese-anode-graphite-2025-07-17/#:~:text=July%2017%20(Reuters)%20%2D%20The,less%20than%20fair%20market%20value.)¬†That‚Äôs big news.

>**Lithium Americas (LAC):**¬†North America‚Äôs largest lithium deposit with big name partnerships¬†[(e.g. GM invested $650 million dollars into it](https://lithiumamericas.com/news/news-details/2024/Unlocking-Thacker-Pass-General-Motors-to-Contribute-Combined-625-Million-in-Cash-and-Letters-of-Credit-to-New-Joint-Venture-with-Lithium-Americas/default.aspx)). This one is as obvious a play as I have ever seen.

>**The Metals Company (TMC):**¬†High risk, high reward. They are awaiting permitting news in the next few months. Unprecedented plan to retrieve minerals from the ocean floor.

I also continue to believe in further upside at¬†**MP materials,**¬†despite their already magnificent run and news.

**II. Import Tariffs via Section 232**

In April, T[rump initiated a Section 232 investigation into the national security threat that critical minerals pose](https://www.whitehouse.gov/fact-sheets/2025/04/fact-sheet-president-donald-j-trump-ensures-national-security-and-economic-resilience-through-section-232-actions-on-processed-critical-minerals-and-derivative-products/).¬†[Likewise as with Copper,](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trump-announces-50-tariff-copper-effective-august-1-2025-07-10/)¬†and as we have seen with Graphite just yesterday (linked above), we are likely to see tariffs roll out on further minerals by way of this investigation. After the report is completed, Trump will have a short amount of time to decide whether to impose tariffs or not on the industry.

Which minerals, though? Theoretically, most of them, as they all are strategic to defense. However, our production capacity is not high for certain areas yet (e.g. heavy rare earths), so what will happen exactly is not known to me entirely.

That being said, we know that the administration is not afraid of stepping up to China boldly, nor are they afraid of import controls and tariffs. This is an area to watch carefully. I expect announcements in the next weeks to months, if not sooner.

Lithium in particular stands out to me. Chinese price-gouging of the spot price has made it almost impossible for domestic producers to be able to compete. Take that information as you wish!

That‚Äôs all for now folks.

GM,2025-07-22,US,"Tesla‚Äôs Easy Money from Regulatory Credits Drying Up Amid Sluggish Sales Tesla's financial model has long been propped up by selling regulatory credits to traditional automakers, but that source of income is rapidly shrinking as U.S. government policies change and Tesla‚Äôs sales falter.

In a key shift, recent changes to environmental laws, particularly under the Trump administration, are set to weaken the demand for these credits. Essentially, regulatory credits have been a way for automakers who make gasoline-powered cars to avoid hefty fines for not meeting pollution standards. Companies like Tesla, which sell electric vehicles (EVs), have been able to make a nice profit by selling these credits to help the likes of GM, Ford, and Honda meet emissions targets.

But now, with the U.S. eliminating fines for automakers who fail to meet certain emission targets, the need for these credits is in sharp decline. Analysts are already slashing their forecasts for Tesla‚Äôs credit revenue, with some predicting it could fall by 40% in 2025 and hit rock bottom by 2027.

While Tesla always knew the credit income wouldn‚Äôt last forever, the speed at which it's disappearing is catching many off guard. In fact, the company‚Äôs first-quarter profit in 2025 would have been a loss without the credit sales. With sales slowing and aggressive price cuts aimed at maintaining market share, the company is more reliant than ever on this income stream.

This shift marks a big win for traditional automakers, as they no longer face as much of a financial incentive to rush into EV production. It‚Äôs also bad news for Tesla‚Äôs bottom line, especially as its once-bustling Model Y sales are cooling off.

Now, investors are bracing for what could be a more difficult road ahead, with fewer regulatory credits coming in and EV subsidies for consumers also set to taper off soon. For Tesla, the big question is whether it can ramp up its robotaxi project or develop other new revenue streams fast enough to offset the credit revenue losses.

The next few quarters could tell us whether Tesla is truly shifting from a regulatory credit-dependent model to a more self-sustaining business  or if it‚Äôs facing a future of shrinking profits as the credit gravy train grinds to a halt.",stocks,1.0,48.88999938964844,52.403333028157554,52.403333028157554
GM,2025-07-23,US,"General Motors / Toyota Motors pair - Market reacting to US-Japan trade deal, selling GM and buying TM. Early reaction of the market is a strong sell-off of US automakers versus Japanese automakers. || Donald Trump didn‚Äôt save the auto industry. He ruined it.

Seriously. Trump didn‚Äôt save anything. He‚Äôs been shouting *‚ÄúTAX! TAX! TAX!‚Äù* for months, and all that did was completely destroy confidence in the automotive sector.

Look at what just happened recently:

* Stellantis? Crushed.
* Renault? Crushed.
* Porsche? Not even funny anymore ; that stock is in the ... We‚Äôre seeing prices we haven‚Äôt seen in ages.
* GM -8% yesterday...

Meanwhile? Chinese EV companies like BYD, Xiaomi, and others (Xpeng, Li Auto, Zeekr ...) just keep going *up and up and up*. All Trump managed to do was give even more momentum to profitable Chinese groups. Bravo.

And now suddenly, he says, ‚ÄúWe signed a deal with Japan,‚Äù and premarket we see Toyota and Honda up 10%+ ... and he claims credit like he‚Äôs some genius. Bro, no. All you did was break things, constantly, and now the market is *flat* only because you *stopped* making it worse.

If he had literally just said *nothing*, the economy and the auto sector would be in better shape. Am I wrong?

Thanks || Statistically GOOG probably tanks on earnings Price before earnings represents the dealer hedge against the bet. Because people are betting on a price drop, say from $168 to $150. The dealer instead has to raise the price to $186, otherwise there's a free ""arbitrage"" to earn ""free money"". (A bet that the move is $18 == a hedge of $18 favoring the dealer so they take the spread at the trade and are neutral to the price).

So while not always true, especially in legitimately unexpected earnings results; when price rises into earnings, big money is betting against the earnings.

When price falls into earnings, big money is betting for the earnings.

It's very simple sports-betting type stuff.

If you look at GOOGs own earnings history you can see that about 75% of the time the Earnings marked a top where price rose, or a bottom where price fell into earnings. So just there you see a roughly 75% chance that GOOG's price falls after earnings over the next quarter.

PS - as the first commenter points out. It does not necessarily mean ""sell everything chicken little"". But if you want to play earnings it's probably better to wait and DCA if the price goes down on your favored stocks. Rather than try to play a rally that you won't sell anyway because \*YOU\* are probably a typical investor who buys and holds.

In the case of GOOG, I'd wait and see regardless. I don't see a point in buying it at this price. And I think weak tech earnings will signal an earnings recession anyway.

GOOG,2025-07-24,US,"Not all top 10 tech stocks are the same A lot is being said about the high valuations and long outperformance of the tech stocks and how risky and overvalued they are as a bunch. But there's an enormous difference just among the top 10 tech stocks by size.

TSLA is trading at a PE of 177 which doesn't make the remotest bit of sense based on the business that they are in (cars) and could be in (robotaxis, robots, and AI), even if they were wildly successful in new business areas (in which they face stiff competition) there is no way to justify the current valuation.

PLTR's PE is over 600 not much more I need to say about that.

GOOG is trading at a PE of 21. Its core search business is going to be disrupted by AI but it is still entrenched and they have the time and resources to adapt. Meanwhile they own the largest streaming platform in YouTube, and arguably the most actually successful robotaxi business in Waymo. If they were ever split up the parts would be worth far more than the sum.

AAPL's heyday is behind it since their growth is anchored in devices and they will probably never acquire significantly more market share in phones meanwhile they have to create a new Fortune 500 sized business every year just to try to keep the growth going.

AMZN on the other hand is not bound by any particular industry or market. They are getting into satellites, pharmaceutical delivery, health care, and can pick any large market they want to address.

MSFT's new leadership after the atrocious Ballmer has brought the company into huge new markets and they are well positioned to capitalize on AI, with a PE of 39 they are not cheap but by far not the most expensive with solid growth prospects.

I personally think that social media is a scourge upon the earth and is destroying the minds of young and old people alike, but META has essentially monopolies that will not be disrupted. 

Meanwhile these companies are investing nearly $300 billion in cap ex per year and have returned nearly $1 trillion to shareholders in buybacks and dividends over the past 5 years.

Uber (UBER.N), opens new tab will invest $300 million in electric vehicle maker Lucid (LCID.O), opens new tab in a robotaxi deal that aims to start with one major U.S. city late next year, the companies said on Thursday.
Over six years starting in 2026, Uber will acquire and deploy over 20,000 Lucid Gravity SUVs that will be equipped with autonomous vehicle (AV) technology from startup Nuro, the three companies said in a statement.


The agreement illustrates the renewed plans and push for financing for self-driving cabs years after a first wave of autonomous driving investment produced only a limited number of vehicles. Tesla has recently launched a robotaxi trial in Austin and Alphabet's (GOOGL.O), opens new tab driverless taxi unit Waymo is speeding up its expansion.

My original plan was to roll the funds through short term T-bills while attending school which would be risk free and yield decent returns. However, I'm exploring the idea of allocating the remaining $64k (after paying for the first year) into one or two solid companies that could see solid upside in the next 2/3 years. If everything goes well, I would then liquidate a portion of the position for each payment period (after 1 year). The school provides 4 payment periods throughout each semester thankfully.

I‚Äôm mainly considering large-cap names that I believe are either fairly valued or potentially undervalued. AAPL, GOOGL, and LLY are on my radar. MSFT is also in the mix as a durable compounder. I‚Äôm intentionally avoiding anything too speculative or volatile (like TSLA or NVDA), and I‚Äôm not looking at mid-cap or high-beta plays.

Are there any companies this community sees as fitting into this plan or should I likely stick with fixed income? I would greatly appreciate any insights or ideas on where you‚Äôd look if you were in a similar situation.

Thanks in advance.","investing, stocks",5.0,190.22999572753906,186.46857125418526,186.46857125418526

The move marks an early step toward modernizing the infrastructure that underpins most of the financial ecosystem. If adopted broadly, it could make it easier and faster for institutional investors to use these assets as collateral and reduce trade settlement times.
BlackRock (BLK.N), opens new tab, BNY Investments Dreyfus, Federated Hermes, Fidelity Investments and Goldman Sachs Asset Management are among the companies participating in the initial rollout.


Goldman Sachs (GS.N), opens new tab and BNY (BK.N), opens new tab have joined hands to launch digital tokens that mirror shares of money market funds, deepening Wall Street's push to bring blockchain technology into traditional finance.
Investors can now buy and sell money market fund shares on BNY's LiquidityDirect platform, with a digital record of those shares created on Goldman's blockchain system, the two financial giants said on Wednesday.


Other asset managers are also exploring tokenization. In January, Apollo (APO.N), opens new tabpartnered with, opens new tab Securitize to launch a feeder fund that would channel capital from crypto-native investors into its global credit fund.
GAINING TRACTION
While it is still a subject of debate, tokenization's potential to drastically reshape the investing landscape has drawn strong interest.
It is being touted as the next breakthrough for bridging the gap between traditional and digital finance, with supporters saying it could open up an asset class that has long been out of reach for retail investors.


""We're at the precipice of doing something very special, and that's really the democratization of markets,"" said Chris Perkins, president of crypto investment firm CoinFund.
The growing interest in tokenization coincides with the renewed optimism in the crypto industry, which has rallied in recent months and gained momentum after the Genius Act was passed earlier this month.
Critics, however, say tokenization could allow companies to bypass the guardrails put in place to protect retail investors.


Companies may also not consent to having their securities tokenized. Earlier this month, OpenAI objected to Robinhood's (HOOD.O), opens new tab tokens tied to its private shares.",stocks,1.0,717.52001953125,707.0514351981027,707.0514351981027

To keep it simple. the chart‚Äôs in a confirmed uptrend. higher highs higher lows since may. pulled back from 13.55 to the 11s, been chopping around there for like 2 weeks. doesn‚Äôt look like a top. looks like a flag. 50 day is about to cross 200 day, golden cross coming. if it breaks 13.50 with volume, prob runs fast to 16‚Äì18.

options flow‚Äôs been good. 123k calls traded in a day (june 24). OI heavy at 12.50 and 15. if we break out, market makers gonna hedge, could pop quick. short interest is massive too, 33% of float. any positive news and this could squeeze.

fundamentals solid. rev up 151% YoY. guidance is 97% growth this year. they got 1.2B in backlog signed already, and they‚Äôre in over 10k QSR stores now. rumours going round they‚Äôre pitching mcdonalds drive-thru contract after IBM fumbled it. even a piece of that would be big.

setup right now:

* price holding above rising MAs
* golden cross any day now
* calls stacked, big OI
* short float huge
* earnings aug 7 could set it off

earnings is the main thing. if they beat and raise, we go. if they talk backlog + 2026 growth, analysts prob upgrade too. if it‚Äôs flat, it might just chop more.

positioning‚Äôs interesting, retail heavy long, instits short. so it's volatile. but i think odds favour bulls short term esp with AI hype still going. Currently doing low volume days but I believe this will change in the next few weeks.

Here‚Äôs how the company did in comparison with LSEG consensus:

* **Earnings per share:**¬†$2.80 adjusted vs. $2.64 expected
* **Revenue:**¬†$16.98 billion vs. $16.59 billion

IBM‚Äôs revenue increased nearly 8% year over year in the quarter, according to a¬†statement. Growth in the¬†first quarter¬†was below 1%. Net income, which includes costs related to acquisitions, rose to $2.19 billion, or $2.31 per share, from $1.83 billion, or $1.96 per share, a year ago.

Software revenue climbed about 10% to $7.39 billion, exceeding the $7.43 billion consensus among analysts surveyed by StreetAccount. Hybrid cloud revenue, including Red Hat, showed 16% growth. The software unit‚Äôs gross margin of 83.9% was barely narrower than StreetAccount‚Äôs 84.0% consensus.

Revenue from consulting rose almost 3% to $5.31 billion, higher than StreetAccount‚Äôs $5.16 billion consensus. Infrastructure revenue went up 14% to $4.14 billion, above the $3.75 billion StreetAccount average estimate.

During the quarter, IBM announced the next-generation¬†z17¬†mainframe computer and the acquisition of data and artificial intelligence consulting firm¬†Hakkoda.

IBM called for over $13.5 billion in 2025 free cash flow, similar to a projection from April. The company still sees at least 5% revenue growth at constant currency for the year.

[David T Hung, CEO of NUVB](https://preview.redd.it/v7v95xljoodf1.png?width=248&format=png&auto=webp&s=6438b90616473c76a5018bffa9e51a57155a5691)

Don't you see what I see? fuck you regard, you want me cancel but I won't say it just watch this video [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FoYC\_8cutb0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FoYC_8cutb0) and come back

This isn't this guy first rodeo, he has been through it he previously built and sold Medivation (XTANDI¬Æ) to Pfizer even after a rough patch because of their phase 3 failure he was able to turn things around and bring a whopping 20x for its investors.

Not convinced yet? Look at the damn [CFO](https://www.crunchbase.com/person/philippe-sauvage). Yes he looks like a regard but he is a regard that been through it and his fucking name is Philippe Sauvage. Fuck if James Bond vilain doesn't make you want to invest, I don't know what will.

**Seasoned leadership** that have barely sold any stocks since the start of the company, heck they bought a shit ton of it.

The buying **increased by a lot** in the last year

And yes David and Sauvage have been **deep** in it (no pun intended)

Hedge funds are in it too, BlackRock increased its position

**Competition**? 18 Jun 2025 NCCN update places IBTROZI as a **Preferred option in every treatment line** and **explicitly for brain mets & post-crizotinib resistance**.

Balance sheet?

\- **$462 M cash** (Mar-25).  
\- **$200 M Sagard royalty + debt** already drawn  
**- Zero use of the $200 M ATM to date.**

They can expand without any foreseable dillution.

Key events?

This people are not casually running through a marathon, **they are sprinting**:

**-** Early shipments start July-25 (triggers $50 M Sagard tranche).  
**-** Q2 call 6 Aug-25 ‚Äì first script numbers & 2025 guidance.  
**-** WCLC Sept + ESMO Oct ‚Äì long-term CNS & RWE data.  
\- Japan approval decision Dec-25.

The play?

Bought some long dated options but have been increasing my shares positions in my account that has not been restricted to penny stock.  
In total I have \~**40k+ invested in NUVB** across multiple accounts and I am DCA-ing so keep an eye on it.

Labubu is becoming a global phenomenon with, it seems like, people of all ages similar to a Hello Kitty or Miffy. They also have collaborations with Disney, Toei Animation, and other companies that have built-in audiences. There's an element of gambling with the blind boxes, a model that's popular in Asia and seems to be a growing trend here in the US. Their revenue growth has also been exploding.

IT,2025-07-21,US,"Verizon Beats Estimates, Microsoft in Security Crisis, Equinix Gets Aggressive Buy as Tech Earnings Week Begins This week's market focus will be on big tech company earnings reports. Today's pre-market index gains, especially in Nasdaq futures, reflect the market's expectations for tech stocks. Here are four stock moves I'm watching:



üîπ Microsoft (MSFT): down 0.3% premarket as SharePoint software was revealed to be under ‚Äúactive attack‚Äù. The software is widely used within government and business. Microsoft has issued a security patch, but the incident may have a short-term impact on customer confidence.

üîπ Alaska Airlines (ALK): up 0.9% premarket. Operations have now resumed despite a nationwide flight suspension due to an IT outage. Both the company and its subsidiaries have suffered recent cybersecurity incidents, which may prompt them to step up their IT investments in the future.



üîπ Equinix (EQIX): 2.5% pre-market gain after activist investor Elliott adds stake. Elliott has reportedly become one of the top 10 shareholders in EQIX. The company is a data center REIT with potential long-term upside in AI data processing needs.



üìä Personal view:



For Microsoft, this security incident may be a stock price disruptor in the short term, but the long term still needs to look at its cloud services and AI deployment capabilities.

IT,2025-07-22,US,"Redditors working in IT, how do you feel about Cisco? Some analysts are saying Cisco might be a great buy given it is undervalued compared to other AI infrastructure plays. But is it an AI play or just another cautionary tale? Some questions:

* How exciting is the partnership with Nvidia? Nvidia has their own networking products so how will this work? Will Nvidia end up just using Cisco's connections to get in front of Enterprise customers and then just bypass Cisco a few years from now after Nvidia lays the foundations?

* Cisco is bragging that they've hit their $1 billion revenue with hyperscaler goal a quarter early. Is this sustainable? How excited should a Cisco investor be about this? 

* During a joint interview, Jensen said Nvidia and Cisco will work to ""rerack"" all the Enterprise networks because the new agentic AI is going to need different equipment. They estimated this is a 2-4 trillion market opportunity. Do you believe this? Has this already been priced into Cisco?

* Cisco ""wants to unify Management, Identity, Security, IoT, and Monitoring with Networking and they are farther along than any other company"" (credit u/idleline). Do you agree with this statement? Is this a clear competitive advantage not yet priced into the stock?

Overall Cisco seems like it might be where Oracle was last year. A cheap way to get into AI picks and shovels play. On the other hand, lots of people on Reddit seems to dislike Cisco for it's expensive prices and confusing/predator licensing. || Wtf is going on with GPRO?? I had like $40 sitting my account and bought some GoPro stock at around $.77/ share. Yeah I know the company has issues (burning through cash, losing market share, no clear future vision etc.) but I love my GoPro, and think there is definitely some value in the brand and a possibility for a turnaround of the stock.

That being said, wtf is going on with GPRO? It's up \~17% today and \~50% since last week. I haven't heard of any big announcements from the company, nor do I see any big institutions/ firms buying up shares...

Edit- it‚Äôs up in the after hours to around $2.20. Obviously there‚Äôs a pump and dump scheme going on here (NO IM NOT A PART OF IT). This is the best trade I‚Äôve ever made in my life - **I‚Äôm up 174% (with my 10 shares @ $.77, that‚Äôs a $13.55 profit üòé)** || NVDA will see a massive correction as the ai bubble pops Everyone and their mom thinks AI will replace humans, send us to the nearest star, and grant us immortalityall within the next five years. I can't even scroll online without seeing the word ""AI."" AI this, AI that. But here's what I've learned from the crypto and NFT crazes: when everyone thinks something will change the world, it usually goes the exact opposite direction.

I expect a **massive spike up in NVDA** after the Fed lowers rates, but give it a year or two max, and reality is going to hit us like a freight train, bro. **AI is the most massive bubble we have ever seen**, and the reckoning will be worse than the housing market crash. Here are my main reasons why:

1. **AI is the greatest illusion of our time.** I've used ChatGPT plenty. It's great at generating word salad and generic code, but when it comes to doing **ACTUAL work** or fixing real problems, it just gives you more word salad instead of solutions. They claim AI can pass the hardest math tests? Sure, it can, because they've already fed it the answers. Try this: go to ChatGPT or any AI model and give it five documents with daily returns for five stocks. Ask it to generate a table showing each company's return for every six-month interval. All models will fail. Not only would it take ages, but it would require running Python code to even attempt it, instead of just giving you the direct answer.
2. **The biggest players in the industry CEOs, VCs, investment fund heads who are throwing the most money around have zero technical skills and absolutely no idea how LLMs actually work.** They're either straight-up lying to pump up their stocks, or they're genuinely retarded, thinking something that runs on a Mac Studio is intelligent or anything close to that. CEOs are always right, right? Remember when Zuck renamed his entire company after the metaverse? That same guy said AI would replace all developers by mid-2025. Well, here we are in mid-2025, and not only has Meta paid the most money ever for a developer, but guess what? They have 2,000 job openings for engineers!
3. **All these keynotes promoting AI seem specifically tailored for investors they don't care about anyone else.** It's like they're screaming, ""BUY OUR STOCK, IT WILL GO TO THE MOON,"" but they can't legally say it. Jensen Huang has been openly mocking Masayoshi Son about selling NVDA stock at every public appearance, almost like he'll do the same to you if you sell!
4. **So far, companies have invested massively and saved very little money.** Microsoft, for example, recently claimed they saved $500 million because of AI, but they also invested $50 billion. The media went into a frenzy reporting on how much money they saved, as if $500 million is a great return on $50 billion.
5. **In Silicon Valley, the craziness has reached unimaginable heights.** Everyone and their dog has an AI startup getting $50 million in seed money, promising ""agentic AI models"" that will analyze your cat's poop and order Amazon food based on its constipation levels. On LinkedIn alone, there are 20,000 job openings in San Francisco for AI engineers, while there are only about 1,000 actual AI engineers available. Companies like Meta are paying $200 million for top engineers.
6. **There's almost no competitive advantage anymore, as open-source models are nearly as good as private ones.** All the big companies are monopolies in their fields. How can you maintain a monopoly when your product is free, open source, and runs on a Mac Studio?
7. **All major AI companies have predicted AGI (Artificial General Intelligence) would be here by now.** Yet, AGI is always ""one year away.""
8. **When everyone thinks something will happen, it always goes the other direction.**
9. **Big, revolutionary changes have never happened in a year or two.** The internet, for example, took 20 years to achieve mass adoption.","wallstreetbets, investing, stocks",3.0,356.5199890136719,358.3133290608724,358.3133290608724

JPM,2025-07-21,US,"CRSP: Momentum Building 

Crispr gene editing biotech with strong balance sheet and several readouts in 2nd half of 2025 and 1st half of 2026. Recently a director bought $50mil of stock, the largest  purchase in many years. And not just any director, the managing partner of SR One, the spinout of GSK‚Äôs corporate venture arm. This guy knows what he is doing. A few weeks ago he posted on linkedin about 3 portfolio companies of SR One closing $1B in pharma partnerships. He knows what pharma looks for. CRSP probably will not be an acquisition target given its size (based on JPM HC last year), but partnerships and selling off assets with more proof of concept is a very real possibility in my opinion. Maybe even acquisition given its game changing pipeline with more data.

CRSP has one approved treatment (Casgevy) that is ex vivo (meaning cells from patients are removed, edited using crispr, then reintroduced) for sickle cell. Stock has lagged due to slow rollout and brutal regimen to prepare to treatment. Treatment can only happen in certain centres. CEO has described casgevy as akin to genetic ‚Äúsurgery‚Äù.

The bright side is that in 2025 and 2026, there is estimated to be many more casgevy patients and its administration to increase. Revenue is only recognized once the edited cells are administered back into the body of the patient which can take up to 2 months from removal.

The real game changers are the in vivo therapies they are working on. In vivo, meaning it will edit the cells inside the body. They just got positive phase 1 results for one of their CVD therapies. More to come with readouts.

70% institutional ownership, went up 17% on Friday on director buy. Rock solid balance sheet. More readouts soon. Revenue recognition will put it back on radar. Ready for prime time. Lots of upside.

JPM,2025-07-24,US,"Bond ETFs for EU investors akin to SGOV in returns and liquidity ***To preface this, I've been buying/selling stocks for 4 years I believe, but my knowledge is fairly surface level. And when it comes to any other financial product I am out of my depths.***

Yesterday when reading a pot here I learned about SGOV, they return a 4.53% dividend and pay out every month. I thought this was a very attractive store for my cash instead of my 1.5% savings account here in the EU. But on my brokerage platform they only over the 0-1 year IShares SGOV bonds.

I saw a product that kind of looks similar which is: JPM USD Ultra-short income UCITS ETF. But I have to admit I don't know how different this is compared to SGOV and I am out of my depths on this topic I believe.

I also heard that taking US bonds as someone who pays with euro is not smart since exchange rates can wobble a lot, although this ETF is bought in euro, it is probably pegged to the dollar so there is risk there I assume.

So here is my question. For EU investors what are the options if we are talking about ETFs similar to SGOV with the same kiind of dividend payout and possibly that also pays out more regularly than yearly?

Not asking for someone to tell me where to park my money but I just want to get an idea of the market, I have no clue about bonds. Maybe some reading material as well if you can recommend some? || Invest in Individual stocks of S&P 500 to beat it? If the majority of years of the S&P500 are UP

>Over the weekend, U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said he was confident a trade deal could be struck with the European Union, but warned that the deadline for a baseline 30% tariff is fixed.

>‚ÄúThat‚Äôs a hard deadline, so on August 1, the new tariff rates will come in,‚Äù Lutnick said Sunday on¬†CBS News¬†when asked about the deadline for his¬†EU tariffs.

>He did signal that talks could continue after this date, however, noting: ‚ÄúThese are the two biggest trading partners in the world, talking to each other. We‚Äôll get a deal done. I am confident we‚Äôll get a deal done.‚Äù

>‚ÄúNothing stops countries from talking to us after August 1, but they‚Äôre going to start paying the tariffs on August 1,‚Äù¬†he added.

>Last-ditch talks to reach a trade agreement are ongoing, with the EU hoping it can negotiate a lower tariff rate.

>For one,¬†the EU has a much trickier relationship with U.S. President Donald Trump than the U.K. does. Trump has frequently bemoaned what he sees as an imbalanced trade relationship and unfair trading practices, which the EU denies.

>According to the¬†European Council, total trade between the EU and U.S. amounted to 1.68 trillion euros ($1.96 trillion) in 2024. While the EU ran a trade surplus in goods, it recorded a deficit in services. Overall, the bloc had a surplus of around 50 billion euros last year, when both goods and services are taken into account.

>Last Friday, the¬†Financial Times reported¬†that Trump was pushing for a minimum tariff of 15% to 20% on EU imports in any deal with the bloc. The president was also reportedly happy to keep duties on the auto sector at 25%, a move that would hurt¬†car exporters in Germany particularly hard.

>Speaking to CNBC‚Äôs ‚ÄúEurope Early Edition‚Äù on Monday, Arnaud Girod, head of economics and cross-asset strategy at Kepler Cheuvreux, said a rate of 15% to 20% ‚Äúwould be a total car crash for European exports.‚Äù

>**Mood change in Europe**

>The White House‚Äôs seemingly harsher stance toward Brussels has prompted policymakers to consider how they will respond to a 30% tariff, which would be a steep hike from the current 10% duty that came into effect in April.

>One EU official told CNBC that there has been a clear shift in mood regarding the bloc‚Äôs potential response among all EU member states, except Hungary, whose leader, Viktor Orban, is a Trump ally.

>The bloc‚Äôs potential countermeasures against the U.S. include levies on imports from the U.S. worth 21 billion euros, which are currently on pause until Aug. 6. The European Commission has also prepared a second round of potential tariffs targeting trade worth 72 billion euros.

>Imports ranging from clothing to agricultural products and food and drink items could be affected.

>Meanwhile, the Wall Street Journal and Bloomberg reported that an increasing number of EU member states have signalled their support for the bloc deploying its anti-coercion instrument. This is the EU‚Äôs most powerful trade tool, which would give the European Commission broad powers to take retaliatory action against the U.S.

1. FUNDAMENTALS (aka THE ROTTED CORE)
Innovative Beverage Group, formerly known as Innovative Beverage Group, sold energy drinks. 

They reverse-split 200-for-1, labeled them ‚ÄúQuantum Computing,‚Äù and never looked back. Their market cap is hovering at $3 B, with trailing twelve-month sales of $370 K. 

That‚Äôs ~$8K of valuation for every $1 of revenue. 

They‚Äôve seen a ~1,500 % YTD increase due to weekly call junkies forcing dealers to chase it higher.

‚∏ª

2. REVENUE (LOL)

Last quarter they reported $39,000 in sales.
Perspective: I make more than that behind my Wendy‚Äôs every six days (I‚Äôm busy)

No recurring contracts, no legit customers, just one-off ‚Äúproof of concept‚Äù invoices. Although they did an unreal job of pumping over a 25k non recurring order from nasa.

CEO Dr. William McGann ‚Äúretired‚Äù after ~15 months (May ‚Äô25). Now the interim is the head lab professor‚Äîzero public-company ops history.

CFO seat already on its third backside this year. Latest guy came out of a SPAC that never made it to daylight‚Äî no one wants to sign their financials for too long. 

Board insiders collectively own pocket change; they live on stock they dump every time a shelf registration goes active.

5. EARNINGS / CASH (NOT AS RICH AS THEY TELL YOU)
They brag about ‚Äústrong cash‚Äù: ~$350 M after two equity raises this year.

That pile exists ONLY because the share price is absurd; an ATM faucet grinding 24/7.

Burn rate ~$25‚Äì30 M a year before they scale hardware, so if the share price dumps the cash dies a slow death anyway.

Q1 ‚Äúincome‚Äù was a pure non-cash warrant liability gain‚Äîmasking an ~$8 M operating loss.

6. ASSETS & LIABILITIES (WHAT‚ÄôS REALLY THERE)

		
Cash: 350 mm that we spoke of

Property and equipment: 8 mm lab equipment. So probably like 2 million laser pointers and a few raspberry pis to do gimmicky tricks with. Ooo quantum wow cooool 

Intangibles: 9 M so non peer reviewed patents and some nonsense

Goodwill: 55m accounting tricks from acquiring Qphoton or whatever.  

Liabilities: mostly just recurring operating expenses -22m. They did do a good job recently using equity to pay down debt. 

So: remove the raise cash and you own a garage lab and a stack of patent PDFs for

https://www.cnbc.com/2025/07/14/port-of-los-angeles-record-container-traffic-trade-war-shipping-tariffs.html

KEY POINTS

The Port of Los Angeles says that shipping container traffic has increased as importers race to beat the latest deadlines set by President Trump for tariffs.

Trade from China, while short of a Covid-like surge, has been up ahead of the mid-August deadline for a deal which could raise tariffs on Chinese goods to 145%.

The Port of Los Angeles reported its best June ever for shipping container traffic, an increase in ocean freight that port executives described as a tariff whipsaw effect, with shippers racing to beat President Trump‚Äôs trade taxes, especially a mid-August deadline for tariffs on Chinese goods.

A total of 892,340 twenty-foot equivalent units (TEUs) were processed at the Port of Los Angeles in June, containers that were filled with holiday season and consumer replenishment products. The increase in containers was not a surprise after President Trump lowered the 145% tariff on Chinese goods to 45%. 

The deadline for the tariff negotiations with China is currently set for August 12. An increase in U.S. manufacturing orders from China during the pause helped fuel China‚Äôs trade surplus to $114.7 billion last month.

Port of LA Executive Director Gene Seroka said that more than anything else, the monthly data highlights the tariff whipsaw effect. Imports had slowed significantly in May and continued to drop through the first half of June.

‚ÄúShifting timelines simply mean shifting volume and more uncertainty here at the Port of LA,‚Äù said Seroka. ‚ÄúLooking into August, if everything holds the way we see it right now, I expect volume to ease because of those new tariffs being in place, making it more costly for American importers,‚Äù he said, citing a National Retail Federation forecast for a double-digit percentage drop in cargo volume from August through November at U.S. ports.

For importers, even amid the trade war pause, the cost of the mounting tariffs has been significant for their businesses.

Bobby Djavaheri, president of Yedi Houseware, told CNBC during a monthly container update call hosted by the Port of Los Angeles that the layering of China tariffs plus stainless steel tariffs has greatly increased the tariff bill his firm is paying on air fryers and other kitchen appliances.

‚ÄúBefore the tariffs, one load would have cost between $1,500 to $2,000. Now it‚Äôs between $40,000-$50,000,‚Äù said Djavaheri.

KO,2025-07-21,US,"Selling almost everything but bonds. What I'm keeping. Sold today, CCJ

Selling RIOT, MSTX which were my bitcoin exposures.

Possibly keeping TMC (which I believe in the Deep Sea mining tech). But It's hard to keep something so volatile as a deep sea mine, mining is hard enough.

Will most likely keep:  
JEPQ (I see no reason not to just hold and DCA).

F (Such a good cost basis that I think I'll just keep it as is).

MO

PFE

HRZN (A risky but good historically dividend payer. It risks lower NAV due to IPO drought which will only get worse, but it has a great basket of companies it does private financing with).

TLTW  
TMF (which are my bond exposure, not principal secured).

I have direct bond ownership as well, so I moved over all of my:  
NVDA, MSFT into direct bond ownership at 170 and 500 prices respectively.

This market is just a clown show. People said ""earnings are better now than before"" but they actually aren't. The earnings are ""better"" because of a declining dollar. Which is fine, but that's not the same as ""PE is good"".

The market is grossly over valued going into an earnings recession at best. At worst we get a massive housing crisis that crushes earnings for 30% of the US economy, and a debt crisis that crushes earnings for MSFT, NVDA, META, GOOG, AMZN, etc.

The two halves of the economy that usually plays one off the other are both staring at their own disasters.

What I will buy later.

JEPQ after QQQ corrects (whatever that looks like).  
GLD if 20% drop in gold.  
Bitcoin at $80,000 to $90,000 this cycle.  
CCJ if a 30% or greater correction.  
TMC (if I sell) if it drops to 200day.  
KO if dividend yield reaches 3.3%  
CVX (oil exposure) if I can get a 7.5%+ dividend yield.  
MO at 7%+ Div yield but not stacking right now.

In rate cuts I'll be flipping my TMF/TLTW into mostly TBT and just sell covered calls on that to keep a good cost basis until the next rate hiking cycle. || Another reason to sell this *top* Come August, the $SPY will be 23% higher than it was Aug 2024, but on declining earnings. And earnings will continue to decline going into rate-cuts. The market appears to be calling ""Trump's bluff"" on tariffs, and not behaving rationally. It made sense in February 2025 that we could go a bit higher. And that the April sell off was an over reaction.

But now this is just becoming banana-zone ridiculous blow-off top status in everything.

Southern Company is trading almost at a 50 year low on dividend yield, which is nonsense because Southern Company has NOTHING to do with the ""electricity utility Ai thesis"" that is supposedly driving the high valuations in Utility companies. Instead we are just in an ""everything bubble"" where valuations are absurd and has nothing to do with Ai or Bitcoin or ""cash on the side"" or anything.

It's a classic blow-off top leading into rate cuts. Which means it's more likely to do with Dealer hedging which drags price higher in this case. 

I just moved all my CCJ uranium affiliate over to Bonds (TMF and TLTW specifically). I didn't even wait 1 month for the ""long term capital gains"" because I think in 1 month CCJ will reverse and bonds will rally, negating all the savings a long term capital gain would trigger.

The market usually times itself like that, and because August/September was a good time to buy, CCJ is bound for a crash into August/September as the market denies long-term holders an exit.

Easy trap if you ask me.

As for the broader market. SPY to top out into August makes sense so I'm continuing to add shorts on SPY, SO and KO. My break evens using options are still above the current prices of all three so that's a good short.

I'll add to oil shorts and XLE shorts when the front months start to roll off for me.

L,2025-07-22,US,"$ENVX Enovix Corp undertaking transformative battery tech DD on $ENVX Enovix Batteries Corp (posted on behalf of 2percentisfair on X)

Most battery tech journalism is frustrating because you will hear constant tales of a tech that will double or triple battery capacity, and then of course the change never happens. The reason for this is multi-faceted:

1) what works in a lab often doesn't work in real world conditions,
2) battery materials are like two faced super-models they can be absolutely perfect when looking at one metric, but can have debilitating shortcomings when looking at another, and

3) most of the time you need to see 100 different success stories in parallel to make a dramatic change happen, and the article speaks of the 1 improvement only and speaks as if the other 99 problems have already been solved.

If you're going to see a new type of battery that has the potential not to just dominate current markets, but to create entirely new markets for electrification; a convergence of multiple incredibly difficult to master technologies would need to happen in parallel. And there would need to be enabling tech that would allow each subcomponent to cover the flaws of the other so that in the aggregate you have a well-rounded battery that can dominate.

This type of battery is still a dream, anything more than a whisper and it can vanish. But for those of you who dare to dream with me, let me whisper away and explain what I might be seeing in the industry and how Enovix might play the crucial role in bringing it all together‚Ä¶

*Not financial advice, but if I were giving financial advice, I would advise you to assess ENVX based on the AI-1 battery and your assumptions as to market share, manufacturing, and margins that it can take in the  Consumer electronics space in the coming years.

So what type of potential battery am I talking about? A solid-state (sulfide based), sulfur cathode battery, with a pre-lithiated si anode. This type of battery would be sourced from cheap, scalable, and abundant materials with an energy density that could potentially enable regional flight or trans-pacific cargo shipping. But every step in that chain has immense hurdles to overcome before you can  get there. Let's evaluate the potential and the hurdles one by one, and let's see how it fits into the Enovix tech stack.

Let's start first with our baby, Enovix. I won't go deep into the details because my followers already know the story well. Enovix is not a Si battery company, it's a novel battery architecture, that has properties that enable it to use non-traditional battery materials. One such property is its ability to handle electrodes that swell. Electrodes that swell are the best kind, they swell because they are storing so much lithium they form a new alloy and balloon up in size. Intercalating (traditional) battery materials on the other hand can only store a little bit of lithium because they store the lithium between layers, like a bookshelf holding books.

So if you can build a battery mechanically designed to handle swelling, you've invented a new class of batteries. You've invented conversion class batteries.

But how does Enovix do this? Through a very simple trick in physics. Force=Pressure*Area. Enovix laser dices its electrodes and then stands them on their thin edge and stacks those thin edge standing electrodes for the width of their cell. What that has done is re-oriented the large face of the electrodes to the sides of the battery and not to the top of the battery. If using conversion style electrodes that swell, the larger part of the elctrodes are facing the small face of the battery (the side)  and not the large one. So again, F=P*A and what you've just done is dramatically reduced the A in the equation. That means you can dramatically reduce the F required in the equation to achieve a P that can constrain the urge to swell. Indeed, because of the orthogonal stacking, Enovix can easily add 10 Megapascals of stack pressure to the solid electrodes (the liquid electrolyte is under normal pressure) with a tiny constraint system. Typical prismatic cells have stack pressure around 0.1 Mpa maybe to up to 1 Mpa.

And then as a bonus, the shape of these electrodes stood on their thin edge provides easy access to pre-lithiate si anodes.

And then as an even better bonus the orientation just happens to be perfectly shaped like a heat exchanger. Having all of these strips of electrodes oriented this way allows uniform and very close access to cooling. We're talking 33x more efficient cooling. You can get the heat out of the center of the cell uniformly with ease.

There are other advantages, but for the rest of this discussion, Enovix's ability to provide stack pressure and its ability to provide extreme thermal control are going to be the two properties of the architecture that enable the rest of the magic I will soon discuss.


The next element of that super battery I need to discuss is the solid state element. ""Solid state is the holy grail of battery development"" is a common refrain. That's mostly marketing (inside joke for me), but solid state does have some extreme advantages.

Upsides:
1) Imagine picking up two bags of sand. One is wet and one is dry. Which one is lighter? A lot lighter

2) Because the electrolyte layer IS the separator, you get rid of the inactive separator. You also get rid of other inactive components that don't need to be there if there is no liquid electrolyte.

3) Often conflated with solid state tech is actually just anode side improvements. Solid state often works better with pure lithium metal on the anode side than can be done with liquid electrolytes; in a liquid electrolyte you have a more unstable SEI layer and in solid state you can have a stronger anode electrolyte      interface which can enable pure lithium metal anodes. That translates to serious gains for the whole system similar to what enovix sees by making massive anode side improvements using si. *I'm still skeptical on lithium metal working in the real world. It always will work in the lab, but lithium metal exists nowhere in nature as li metal because its too reactive.

4) No flammable electrolyte reduces fire hazard.

Downsides:
A battery is just a reversible chemistry reaction where negative electrons (electricity) flow in and out and positive ions (lithium in this case) flow back and forth between two electrodes. The flow of those positive ions is easier to facilitate in a liquid vs in a solid. But serious progress has been made using solids.

Ionic conductivity: this is the challenge of moving positive ions around. Surprisingly, sulfide based      electrolyte layers are getting so good that their Siemens per centimeter (how much resistance to moving ions) is approaching that and sometimes      exceeding liquid electrolytes. Quite frankly, this is miracle number 1 in the whole chain. The better the ionic conductivity, the thinner the electrolyte gets to be and just like regular separators thinner is better both for volume and for weight and for cost. Sulfide solid state has a clear advantage over oxide/ceramic based ones that have to be thicker both for ionic conductivity reasons and for brittleness reasons.

Interfacial Connection: think  of a relay race. The ionic conductivity is how fast the runners can run but the interface between the cathode->solid electrolyte->anode is like the baton exchange in a relay race. This is where SSB's tend to struggle. But it turns out, with sulfide based electrolyte layers high stack pressure can greatly improve the interfacial connection allowing for  a uniform and seamless connection between the layers of battery. (*hint, Enovix architecture easily provides stack pressure).

Hot spots and heat transfer issues. The liquid electrolyte doesn't just transfer the ions effectively,      it also transfer heat around the cell, bringing it to the edge of the cell where it can cooled. Without that liquid electrolyte, even though its less flammable, those hot spots will kill cycle life and cause degradation issues if not dealt with. *If only there were a perfect architecture for thermal control.

Dendrites in a lithium metal anode. Sulfide based SSB are considered more prone to dendrites than oxide      based SSB's. This is likely why NIO, makes their semi-solid state battery based on a sulfide layer with a prelithiated Si-C mix on the anode side rather than the lithium metal side. (I wonder who else can do that anode side trick‚Ä¶.but at a much higher % of Si-C?)

Moisture sensitivity: sulfides are extremely sensitive to moisture and current manufacturers like Toyota have worked to use additives and coatings that make it less      so.

Manufacturability: Can you make the electrolyte? Once you've made that, can you then use it when      manufacturing the cell itself? Sulfide based electrolytes are extremely sensitive to moisture and oxygen, and using them to make a cell would likely require at least some of the steps to be done in a pure argon or a pure nitrogen environment, which means lights off automation would be required for those steps.

I don't want to understate the challenge here. Being able to allow ion transfer in a solid electrolyte is incredibly challenging to make happen in a cell, and incredibly difficult to manufacture in a scalable process. But there are at least two companies (Nio and Cherry) already taking this trick to production ready cells in China, and companies like Toyota/Samsung/Solid Power all have made incredible progress. Sulfide based SSB's are clearly stepping out of the proof of concept stage and starting to be ready for the next level. If you add in an architecture that easily adds stack pressure and thermal control, you might be on to something‚Ä¶

$ENVX

We've now made it to the cathode side of this super battery equation. Sulfur based cathodes. Unlike every single other battery cathode on the marketplace today that is intercalating, sulfur is a conversion style cathode. That means it forms an alloy with the lithium and can store much Much MUCH more lithium than anything else on the market. It's also incredibly abundant, cheap, and light.

So why the hell are you just hearing about it now? Did an anon on Twitter discover this wonder battery material under everyone's nose? Of course not. Sulfur is the definition of the two-faced supermodel. It's amazing in some respects, and atrocious in other respects. If you can find a way to cover its weaknesses, you have a potential super battery.

What are those weaknesses? First and foremost you have serious cycle life issues resulting from ""polysulfide shuttling."" Lithium sulfur undergoes multiple reactions when it takes in and then releases lithium and in this process tiny ""polysulfides"" can escape to the anode side and this absolutely wrecks any hope of cycle life you had with the battery. Current lithium sulfur cathode makers are trying to mitigate this by using various carbon products to trap the polysulfides before they shuttle away.

But it turns out there is a much more effective way to contain the number 1 problem of polysulfide shuttling. The solution is to pair sulfur based cathodes with sulfide based solid state electrolytes. This 100% filters out any polysulfides shutting all the way to the anode. 100%. Now there likely still is some impact from cathode side only polysulfide shuttling, but we're talking 95% of the problem is solved for you if you can pair sulfur cathode with sulfide electrolyte.

So once again, did I, an anon on twitter just discover this amazing trick that has eluded battery chemists for decades? Of course not. As a conversion style cathode, Sulfur expands and contracts by up to 80% of its volume in charge and discharge. This means that the number one unsolved problem for SSB's, that of interfacial contact between the layers, becomes virtually impossible to do with sulfur based cathodes making the point moot. 

But what if you have a battery architecture that can easily add in extremely high stack pressure in such a way that the expansion is controlled. The interface between the particles even in a sulfur cathode are perfectly uniform and perfectly in contact with a sulfide based electrolyte? That's exactly what Enovix can do. 

But sulfur's amazing potential isn't purely held back by polysulfide shuttling. It also is known for very low power output. We're talking 0.1 C power output (weak sauce), when the batteries required for drones are going to need to be on the order of 10C. This is where the work of the cathode manufacturers pairing it with new types of easily made carbon are making massive amounts of progress. Multiple companies and universities are now testing lithium sulfur based cathodes that are both high capacity and high power now, unheard of only a few years ago.

The next downside to sulfur unfortunately is volumetric density. Gravimetrically it is untouchable. Volumetrically it is weak. Cathode makers have to use low sulfur loading to increase its power output and also a lot of binder to glue it together during its expansion and contraction. In addition, they try to space it out pretty far apart to allow for said expansion and contraction. Once again, the Enovix high stack pressure can make a dramatic difference here. It can greatly reduce the amount of binder required, and the mechanical system is designed for the stuff to be packed in tight, because it is a conversion class battery designed to handle the swell.

The final problem I will discuss is one of heat. All Enovix investors know, the secret to extreme fast charge is rapid and uniform heat extraction from the center of the cell during charging. Fast charge brings in a ton of resistive heating related to bringing all that power in at once. But lesser known, is the fact that most intercalating cathode materials have a slightly endothermic reaction when the cathode gives up the lithium during charging. This means the chemical reaction that occurs during charging of say an LCO cathode, actually reduces the heat in the cell not adds to it. But sulfur is different. When it gives up the lithium, that multi stage reaction is exothermic at every stage. Meaning, if you want to fast charge you now have to get the resistive heat (resistive heat is why a toaster gets hot) out as well as the heat from the chemical reaction itself. And to add pain to this equation, if you're doing all of this in a solid state battery, you don't have a liquid that can rapidly transfer the heat from the center of the cell to the edge. If you don't have a battery form factor/architecture specifically designed for rapid heat extraction, you are going to create hotspots that kill the cycle life of your battery.

Hopefully now you are starting to see why having a battery that can provide high stack pressure and extreme thermal control is not just a nice to have, but is absolutely crucial to making this type of battery work.

$ENVX

We're now to the anode side. I won't belabor this point because everyone knows this is already where Enovix shines. It takes 100% Si-C, prelithiates it, and then uses that anode side advantage in conjunction with regular LCO on the cathode to create the AI-1 battery that is about to take the high margin consumer electronics space by storm.

I will reiterate, that the knock on sulfide based solid state electrolyte is that it is more prone to dendrite formation when compared with oxide based SSB. So while sulfides are basically twice as ionically conductive allowing it to be much thinner (both lighter and more volumetrically dense), it may not be as reliable when using lithium metal. Well, the very easy solution to this is to use si on the anode side, especially if you're partnering with a si anode expert.

BTW, NIO currently makes semi-solid state batteries (using traditional cathode materials and retaining half the liquid weight because its only semi solid state), and they use si on the anode side presumably for this exact reason. In real world conditions, the only route to get to extremely high cycle life for this type of battery is si on the anode side not li metal imho.

$ENVX

Let me summarize. There is a whisper of a dream for a potential battery that would not just be an upgrade to existing batteries, it would be a world changing technology that future historians would list alongside the invention of the steam engine. But in order to achieve this multiple miracles from an entire ecosystem of companies and universities would have to happen in parallel and the subcomponents all have to work in concert to hide each other's weaknesses.

But, in theory.....

1) The main weakness of the  sulfur based cathode (polysulfide shuttling) can be solved by using a      sulfide based SSB

2) The main weakness of a SSB, especially when paired with an expanding and contracting sulfur based      cathode (interfacial connectivity), can be solved by high stack pressure easily achieved using Enovix architecture.

3) The second main weakness for sulfur based cathodes of volumetric density, can be dramatically improved by the high stack pressure easily achieved using Enovix Architecture.

4) The serious problem of dendrite formation from a sulfide based SSB can be solved using pre lithiated si on the anode side rather than li metal, a technique Enovix has already perfected.

5) The serious problems regarding heat extraction and thermal control that would come from a sulfur based cathode having exothermic reactions during charging, and made  worse by an all solid battery without the liquid electrolyte to transfer heat around, would have to be solved by a battery architecture that      specifically enables rapid and uniform heat extraction.

All of this would have to be manufactured by teams of experts capable of manufacturing in extreme      environments. Microchip manufacturers do that every day.

Other problems like power output for sulfur based cathodes or ionic conductivity for sulfide based solid electrolytes are immensely challenging, but appear to be being solved by multiple companies as we speak. Enovix potentially can serve as the architecture and partner that enables it all. 

Now the beauty of this whole thing is, it's not a zero to 1 proposition for Enovix. As we speak, Enovix is about to capitalize on being able to produce batteries with JUST the anode side of this equation. The AI-1 battery that is north of 900 Wh/L, has a 3C charge rate, high cycle life, and AI enabling power output is the result of only one side of this equation paired with an LCO cathode. And after that, if they're challenged they'll implement a higher voltage cathode (likely specially coated LCO) to continue their dominance. But in the background, they can be working on bringing together the next gen battery ecosystem required to make this much bigger dream happen. Maybe the next step is just the SSB side. And then the final step would be the sulfur cathode paired with it all. This is all wildly speculative, but extremely exciting. It should at least be known that these potential tech tree combinations appear to be coming together. 

Enovix, come for smartphone opportunity, stay for the chance to change the world. Good luck out there. || hood yolo (and open loss) took the L on OPEN

LEN,2025-07-18,US,"Major Bear Market Inevitable by October - why There's a mechanical reason no one is talking about of why the market will enter a large bear market correction probably around October. It could be massive.

Only 2x before in US history has a sizeable amount of US Federal debt needed to roll over from short term to long term. The first time the US short term debt was about 60% of the total debt. The second time it was 30%.

Currently the short term debt is 40% of the total US debt.  
  
The two previous times were:   
\-1929  
\-2008

In WW1 the US accumulated a large amount of 5 year debt and kept rolling it until about 1925 until it started to roll into long term durations.

WW2 was purposefully financed by almost exclusively 20 year and 30 year debt FOR THE FACT that the roll-over in 1920s was so painful for the Federal government.

The reason this will cause a massive bear market is because rolling short term debt into long term debt \*REDUCES LIQUIDITY\*.

And markets thrive on liquidity. Economies thrive on liquidity.

The current existence of short-term paper == much more liquidity. The roll-over into long term paper will massively reduce liquidity.

When the interest rates peak and start to come down is when money will get sucked out of the system. Also in the housing market supply will tidal-wave hit the market as people try to lock in lower interest rates, this will absolutely crush the housing market.

**""History doesn't repeat but it does rhyme""** \- so what's the next verse?

I think it's DNUT. But if you've got a better idea, drop it in the comments. Here's my case:

# The Setup: OPEN your ahole and KSS DNUTz

Yeah, I went there. But while everyone's drunk on the first two gains, there's a $560M market cap company trading at bankruptcy multiples despite growing revenue.

**Current Price: $3.58**  
**Market Cap: $560M**  
**My Target: $8-12**

Show me another 2-3x opportunity this obvious.

# The Valuation Gap Is Insane

Look at these multiples and tell me this makes sense:

|Company|EV/EBITDA|EV/Sales|Context|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|**DNUT**|**9.2x**|**1.2x**|Priced for bankruptcy despite growth|
|Starbucks|18.9x|3.57x|Premium coffee valuation|
|Restaurant Brands|17.0x|\~5x|Tim Hortons/BK parent|
|Dunkin' (2020 sale)|**23x**|N/A|What buyers actually pay for donuts|

Yet DNUT is:

* Operating **17,982 points of access globally**
* Posted 5% organic growth in FY2024
* Has one of the most recognized brands in food

Find me another company this disconnected from fundamentals.

# The Bear Cases Are All Weak

**""Ozempic will kill fast food""** \- I'm a fatass myself and there's no amount of Ozempic that removes my craving for hot, fresh donuts at 2am. Look at MCD and CMG at ATHs. People on Ozempic eat less, not never. A glazed donut is 190 calories of pure dopamine - that demand isn't disappearing.

**""The McDonald's deal ended!""** \- No, the TEST ended after rolling out to 2,400 stores. You think McDonald's spent millions on infrastructure for a 3-month trial? They're analyzing data. If it worked (spoiler: donuts + coffee = money), this goes nationwide.

**""They suspended the dividend!""** \- Good. They're investing in growth instead of paying boomers. That's exactly what you want in a turnaround.

# Three Ways This Plays Out

**Starting Point:**

* Stock: $3.58
* Market Cap: $560M
* Growing business with fixable issues

**Scenario 1: Modest Re-rate (12x EBITDA)**

Still way below peers:

* **Target: $8-9**
* **Return: 125-150%**

**Scenario 2: Industry Average (15x)**

If operations improve:

* **Target: $11-13**
* **Return: 200-250%**

**Scenario 3: Nothing Changes (10x)**

Status quo maintained:

* **Target: $5-6**
* **Return: 40-70%**

Even the bear case would be a healthy return on your money. Show me better risk/reward.

# Why The Setup Is Perfect

‚úì **Meme-able ticker** (DNUT - come on)  
‚úì **Small cap** ($560M = moves fast)  
‚úì **Value play** (half peer multiples)  
‚úì **Real business** (17,982 locations)  
‚úì **Catalyst rich** (McDonald's decision pending)  
‚úì **Acquisition target** (at these multiples) ‚úì **Options flow confirming** (Huge call buying at $5 strike)

# Recent ""Problems"" Are Actually Bullish

* **Q1 revenue down 1%** ‚Üí They sold Insomnia Cookies (portfolio cleanup)
* **Dividend suspended** ‚Üí More cash for growth/turnaround
* **McDonald's test ""ended""** ‚Üí Infrastructure built, awaiting expansion
* **Debt concerns** ‚Üí Manageable at 5x EBITDA, becomes nothing if margins improve

Every QSR turnaround story looks exactly like this before the re-rate.

# But Here's Where I Need Your Input

I'm convinced DNUT is the third play because:

1. **Valuation** \- It's the most undervalued name I can find
2. **Size** \- Small enough to move like OPEN and KSS did
3. **Catalysts** \- McDonald's decision, margin improvements, M&A potential
4. **Meme factor** \- The ticker alone guarantees viral potential
5. **Options flow** \- Big money is already positioning

But maybe I'm missing something. What else fits the pattern?

* Under $1B market cap?
* Trading at distressed multiples?
* Has clear catalysts ahead?
* Meme-able enough for WSB?
* Seeing unusual options activity?

Drop your picks below. But until someone shows me better risk/reward than 7:1 upside, I'm loading DNUT.

# Someone's Already Loading - Check the Options Flow

Here's what really got my attention: MASSIVE call buying the past few days, absolutely exploding today. The $5 strikes are getting hammered with volume.

Someone with deep pockets is betting big on a move above $5. That's a 40% move from here, and they're paying premium for it. When smart money moves this aggressively on a small cap, you pay attention.

This isn't retail buying weeklies. This is institutional-sized flow betting on a re-rate.

[today](https://preview.redd.it/1od3hcy7qgef1.png?width=2150&format=png&auto=webp&s=0af667fdfc86245bc643c1a068a79688b06447dd)

# The Play

The options market is telling you something. When you see this kind of call buying on a beaten-down small cap with clear catalysts, it usually means someone knows something.

Those $5 calls? If DNUT hits just the LOW end of fair value ($8), those are 10-15x. If it hits $12? Those calls print harder than JPow in 2020.

I like the 11/21 $5 call. IV is only at 87% and volume is sufficient at 2k+

https://preview.redd.it/9lghn7dwqgef1.png?width=1858&format=png&auto=webp&s=6e3f654e56abef9da84cf86b0b6c83fa3e7757b2

**My Position:**

https://preview.redd.it/s2v1a859sgef1.png?width=1900&format=png&auto=webp&s=1c006ba69e418e6820ad3344bd8773fd44756bc9

The first two already ran. Don't be late to the third.

Because when McDonald's announces the national rollout, when margins tick up even 100bps, when some PE firm offers 15x EBITDA - this thing gaps to $8+ overnight.

Every distressed QSR (finance bro speak for fast food) that fixed itself got bought:

* Dunkin': 23x EBITDA to Inspire Brands
* Panera: Bought by JAB
* Popeyes: Acquired by RBI
* Buffalo Wild Wings: Taken private by Roark

At current multiples, DNUT is a sitting duck.

The cycle comes in threes:  
OPEN ‚úì  
KSS ‚úì  
???

I say DNUT. The options flow says DNUT. Prove us wrong.

Edit: position update as of 7/23 12:22am (since I keep getting asked for it). I didn't dump on you. Also, as a warning: DO NOT buy afterhours. That shit is too low volume. Just wait til the morning and get a better price

MCD,2025-07-22,US,"[DD] The Value Play Cycle Needs Its Third: Why I'm Betting on DNUT Alright degenerates, we need to talk. OPEN ripped. KSS followed. But these cycles always come in threes, and we're missing the final piece.

**""History doesn't repeat but it does rhyme""** \- so what's the next verse?

I think it's DNUT. But if you've got a better idea, drop it in the comments. Here's my case:

# The Setup: OPEN your ahole and KSS DNUTz

Yeah, I went there. But while everyone's drunk on the first two gains, there's a $560M market cap company trading at bankruptcy multiples despite growing revenue.

**Current Price: $3.58**  
**Market Cap: $560M**  
**My Target: $8-12**

Show me another 2-3x opportunity this obvious.

# The Valuation Gap Is Insane

Look at these multiples and tell me this makes sense:

|Company|EV/EBITDA|EV/Sales|Context|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|**DNUT**|**9.2x**|**1.2x**|Priced for bankruptcy despite growth|
|Starbucks|18.9x|3.57x|Premium coffee valuation|
|Restaurant Brands|17.0x|\~5x|Tim Hortons/BK parent|
|Dunkin' (2020 sale)|**23x**|N/A|What buyers actually pay for donuts|

Yet DNUT is:

* Operating **17,982 points of access globally**
* Posted 5% organic growth in FY2024
* Has one of the most recognized brands in food

Find me another company this disconnected from fundamentals.

# The Bear Cases Are All Weak

**""Ozempic will kill fast food""** \- I'm a fatass myself and there's no amount of Ozempic that removes my craving for hot, fresh donuts at 2am. Look at MCD and CMG at ATHs. People on Ozempic eat less, not never. A glazed donut is 190 calories of pure dopamine - that demand isn't disappearing.

**""The McDonald's deal ended!""** \- No, the TEST ended after rolling out to 2,400 stores. You think McDonald's spent millions on infrastructure for a 3-month trial? They're analyzing data. If it worked (spoiler: donuts + coffee = money), this goes nationwide.

**""They suspended the dividend!""** \- Good. They're investing in growth instead of paying boomers. That's exactly what you want in a turnaround.

# Three Ways This Plays Out

**Starting Point:**

* Stock: $3.58
* Market Cap: $560M
* Growing business with fixable issues

**Scenario 1: Modest Re-rate (12x EBITDA)**

Still way below peers:

* **Target: $8-9**
* **Return: 125-150%**

**Scenario 2: Industry Average (15x)**

If operations improve:

* **Target: $11-13**
* **Return: 200-250%**

**Scenario 3: Nothing Changes (10x)**

Status quo maintained:

* **Target: $5-6**
* **Return: 40-70%**

Even the bear case would be a healthy return on your money. Show me better risk/reward.

# Why The Setup Is Perfect

‚úì **Meme-able ticker** (DNUT - come on)  
‚úì **Small cap** ($560M = moves fast)  
‚úì **Value play** (half peer multiples)  
‚úì **Real business** (17,982 locations)  
‚úì **Catalyst rich** (McDonald's decision pending)  
‚úì **Acquisition target** (at these multiples) ‚úì **Options flow confirming** (Huge call buying at $5 strike)

# Recent ""Problems"" Are Actually Bullish

* **Q1 revenue down 1%** ‚Üí They sold Insomnia Cookies (portfolio cleanup)
* **Dividend suspended** ‚Üí More cash for growth/turnaround
* **McDonald's test ""ended""** ‚Üí Infrastructure built, awaiting expansion
* **Debt concerns** ‚Üí Manageable at 5x EBITDA, becomes nothing if margins improve

Every QSR turnaround story looks exactly like this before the re-rate.

# But Here's Where I Need Your Input

I'm convinced DNUT is the third play because:

1. **Valuation** \- It's the most undervalued name I can find
2. **Size** \- Small enough to move like OPEN and KSS did
3. **Catalysts** \- McDonald's decision, margin improvements, M&A potential
4. **Meme factor** \- The ticker alone guarantees viral potential
5. **Options flow** \- Big money is already positioning

But maybe I'm missing something. What else fits the pattern?

* Under $1B market cap?
* Trading at distressed multiples?
* Has clear catalysts ahead?
* Meme-able enough for WSB?
* Seeing unusual options activity?

Drop your picks below. But until someone shows me better risk/reward than 7:1 upside, I'm loading DNUT.

# Someone's Already Loading - Check the Options Flow

Here's what really got my attention: MASSIVE call buying the past few days, absolutely exploding today. The $5 strikes are getting hammered with volume.

Someone with deep pockets is betting big on a move above $5. That's a 40% move from here, and they're paying premium for it. When smart money moves this aggressively on a small cap, you pay attention.

This isn't retail buying weeklies. This is institutional-sized flow betting on a re-rate.

[past week](https://preview.redd.it/xcxfleepngef1.png?width=2142&format=png&auto=webp&s=b69b385edf49636702af95a44e47b6c3d3038751)

[today](https://preview.redd.it/1od3hcy7qgef1.png?width=2150&format=png&auto=webp&s=0af667fdfc86245bc643c1a068a79688b06447dd)

# The Play

The options market is telling you something. When you see this kind of call buying on a beaten-down small cap with clear catalysts, it usually means someone knows something.

Those $5 calls? If DNUT hits just the LOW end of fair value ($8), those are 10-15x. If it hits $12? Those calls print harder than JPow in 2020.

I like the 11/21 $5 call. IV is only at 87% and volume is sufficient at 2k+

https://preview.redd.it/9lghn7dwqgef1.png?width=1858&format=png&auto=webp&s=6e3f654e56abef9da84cf86b0b6c83fa3e7757b2

**My Position:**

https://preview.redd.it/s2v1a859sgef1.png?width=1900&format=png&auto=webp&s=1c006ba69e418e6820ad3344bd8773fd44756bc9

The first two already ran. Don't be late to the third.

Because when McDonald's announces the national rollout, when margins tick up even 100bps, when some PE firm offers 15x EBITDA - this thing gaps to $8+ overnight.

Every distressed QSR (finance bro speak for fast food) that fixed itself got bought:

* Dunkin': 23x EBITDA to Inspire Brands
* Panera: Bought by JAB
* Popeyes: Acquired by RBI
* Buffalo Wild Wings: Taken private by Roark

At current multiples, DNUT is a sitting duck.

The cycle comes in threes:  
OPEN ‚úì  
KSS ‚úì  
???

I say DNUT. The options flow says DNUT. Prove us wrong.

Edit: position update as of 7/23 12:22am (since I keep getting asked for it). I didn't dump on you. Also, as a warning: DO NOT buy afterhours. That shit is too low volume. Just wait til the morning and get a better price

Selling RIOT, MSTX which were my bitcoin exposures.

Possibly keeping TMC (which I believe in the Deep Sea mining tech). But It's hard to keep something so volatile as a deep sea mine, mining is hard enough.

Will most likely keep:  
JEPQ (I see no reason not to just hold and DCA).

F (Such a good cost basis that I think I'll just keep it as is).

MO

PFE

HRZN (A risky but good historically dividend payer. It risks lower NAV due to IPO drought which will only get worse, but it has a great basket of companies it does private financing with).

TLTW  
TMF (which are my bond exposure, not principal secured).

I have direct bond ownership as well, so I moved over all of my:  
NVDA, MSFT into direct bond ownership at 170 and 500 prices respectively.

This market is just a clown show. People said ""earnings are better now than before"" but they actually aren't. The earnings are ""better"" because of a declining dollar. Which is fine, but that's not the same as ""PE is good"".

The market is grossly over valued going into an earnings recession at best. At worst we get a massive housing crisis that crushes earnings for 30% of the US economy, and a debt crisis that crushes earnings for MSFT, NVDA, META, GOOG, AMZN, etc.

The two halves of the economy that usually plays one off the other are both staring at their own disasters.

What I will buy later.

JEPQ after QQQ corrects (whatever that looks like).  
GLD if 20% drop in gold.  
Bitcoin at $80,000 to $90,000 this cycle.  
CCJ if a 30% or greater correction.  
TMC (if I sell) if it drops to 200day.  
KO if dividend yield reaches 3.3%  
CVX (oil exposure) if I can get a 7.5%+ dividend yield.  
MO at 7%+ Div yield but not stacking right now.

In rate cuts I'll be flipping my TMF/TLTW into mostly TBT and just sell covered calls on that to keep a good cost basis until the next rate hiking cycle.","investing, stocks",4.0,712.969970703125,706.3919921875,706.3919921875

META,2025-07-24,US,"How do RSU's work? i have a very specific question about RSU. or if its different based on company.

when someone gets RSU from a company, is it awarded in straight shares with the FMV at time of grant? or can it sometimes be awarded as cash that represents how many shares it can purchase at the current FMV?

i.e. if you work at Meta. And lets say they give 100 shares vested 20% over 5 years. is that 100 shares valued at, as of right now todays close ignoring after market movements of $713.58 x 100 = $71,358.

or will it instead, show it as $71,358, which are currently worth 100 shares.

I know this sounds like its exactly the same. but let me use an explicit example with these #s

using first option

if they give you 100 shares. essentially $71,358. next year you get 20 shares vested. this is very easy and straight forward. you now own 20 shares, at whatever the FMV is at time of vesting. so if each share is now worth $800, you have 20 shares, each worth $800, so $16000 in your brokerage account.

in option 2, they grant you $71,358. which happens to be coincidentally 100 shares (i.e. they decided to award you not based on how many shares, but just cash value.)

in this case, would it currently simply REPRESENT 100 shares? or actually mean you are entitled to 100 shares?

so next year, 20% of $71,358 vests. which is $14,721.60. at this time, same as scenario above, META is worth $800/share. but because you were given ""cash"", until it vests, its still only worth $14,721.60. which it auto buys into RSU (as per RSU program) at $800/share. so you now have 17.8395 shares. total value $14.721.60. (i.e. cost basis is now what it vests at)

I dont work at meta, but looking at my company's RSU plan, i cant tell which scenario my RSU works in.

is it always option 1? and im just overthinking this?

or is option 2 a thing as well? || Not all top 10 tech stocks are the same A lot is being said about the high valuations and long outperformance of the tech stocks and how risky and overvalued they are as a bunch. But there's an enormous difference just among the top 10 tech stocks by size.

TSLA is trading at a PE of 177 which doesn't make the remotest bit of sense based on the business that they are in (cars) and could be in (robotaxis, robots, and AI), even if they were wildly successful in new business areas (in which they face stiff competition) there is no way to justify the current valuation.

PLTR's PE is over 600 not much more I need to say about that.

GOOG is trading at a PE of 21. Its core search business is going to be disrupted by AI but it is still entrenched and they have the time and resources to adapt. Meanwhile they own the largest streaming platform in YouTube, and arguably the most actually successful robotaxi business in Waymo. If they were ever split up the parts would be worth far more than the sum.

AAPL's heyday is behind it since their growth is anchored in devices and they will probably never acquire significantly more market share in phones meanwhile they have to create a new Fortune 500 sized business every year just to try to keep the growth going.

AMZN on the other hand is not bound by any particular industry or market. They are getting into satellites, pharmaceutical delivery, health care, and can pick any large market they want to address.

MSFT's new leadership after the atrocious Ballmer has brought the company into huge new markets and they are well positioned to capitalize on AI, with a PE of 39 they are not cheap but by far not the most expensive with solid growth prospects.

I personally think that social media is a scourge upon the earth and is destroying the minds of young and old people alike, but META has essentially monopolies that will not be disrupted. 

Meanwhile these companies are investing nearly $300 billion in cap ex per year and have returned nearly $1 trillion to shareholders in buybacks and dividends over the past 5 years. These aren't unprofitable ""dot com bubble"" stocks but entrenched cash cows.","investing, stocks",2.0,718.64501953125,708.6243743896484,708.6243743896484

MSFT,2025-07-21,US,"Verizon Beats Estimates, Microsoft in Security Crisis, Equinix Gets Aggressive Buy as Tech Earnings Week Begins This week's market focus will be on big tech company earnings reports. Today's pre-market index gains, especially in Nasdaq futures, reflect the market's expectations for tech stocks. Here are four stock moves I'm watching:



üîπ Microsoft (MSFT): down 0.3% premarket as SharePoint software was revealed to be under ‚Äúactive attack‚Äù. The software is widely used within government and business. Microsoft has issued a security patch, but the incident may have a short-term impact on customer confidence.



üîπ Verizon (VZ): Shares up 4.6% premarket after Q2 results beat estimates and raised the lower end of its full-year profit estimate range to 1%-3%. Strong wireless service revenue growth and healthy customer base expansion. Adjusted EPS of $1.22 beat estimates.



üîπ Alaska Airlines (ALK): up 0.9% premarket. Operations have now resumed despite a nationwide flight suspension due to an IT outage. Both the company and its subsidiaries have suffered recent cybersecurity incidents, which may prompt them to step up their IT investments in the future.



üîπ Equinix (EQIX): 2.5% pre-market gain after activist investor Elliott adds stake. Elliott has reportedly become one of the top 10 shareholders in EQIX. The company is a data center REIT with potential long-term upside in AI data processing needs.



üìä Personal view:



For Microsoft, this security incident may be a stock price disruptor in the short term, but the long term still needs to look at its cloud services and AI deployment capabilities.

The firm raised its U.S. online ad growth forecast for 2025 to 11% (from 8%), driven by improved sentiment and lowered tariff risks.

  
AMZN is seen with 33% upside to a $300 target, fueled by AWS strength and expected earnings acceleration into H2 2025‚Äì2026. GPU-driven innovation is also boosting sector growth. 

  
Generative AI is expected to be a key earnings driver for GOOGL and META, though Morgan Stanley prefers GOOGL for its more attractive 11% upside (target: $205). Confidence in AI sustainability will be crucial to maintaining momentum. With improving macro conditions and a more bullish outlook on digital advertising and AI, stocks like META, BGM, AMZN, PINS, GOOGL, and ETSY could benefit from renewed investor enthusiasm across the internet and tech ecosystem.

  
Big Tech capex is expected to hit $ 392B in 2026, up 21% YoY, with AMZN, GOOGL, META, and MSFT accounting for 58% of that spend. || Selling almost everything but bonds. What I'm keeping. Sold today, CCJ

 || Going Back to School ‚Äì $64k to Invest I'm returning to school soon, and the cost will be about $36k per year after scholarships. I currently have around $100k in cash. 

My original plan was to roll the funds through short term T-bills while attending school which would be risk free and yield decent returns. However, I'm exploring the idea of allocating the remaining $64k (after paying for the first year) into one or two solid companies that could see solid upside in the next 2/3 years. If everything goes well, I would then liquidate a portion of the position for each payment period (after 1 year). The school provides 4 payment periods throughout each semester thankfully.

I‚Äôm mainly considering large-cap names that I believe are either fairly valued or potentially undervalued. AAPL, GOOGL, and LLY are on my radar. MSFT is also in the mix as a durable compounder. I‚Äôm intentionally avoiding anything too speculative or volatile (like TSLA or NVDA), and I‚Äôm not looking at mid-cap or high-beta plays.

Are there any companies this community sees as fitting into this plan or should I likely stick with fixed income? I would greatly appreciate any insights or ideas on where you‚Äôd look if you were in a similar situation.

But there's an enormous difference just among the top 10 tech stocks by size.

TSLA is trading at a PE of 177 which doesn't make the remotest bit of sense based on the business that they are in (cars) and could be in (robotaxis, robots, and AI), even if they were wildly successful in new business areas (in which they face stiff competition) there is no way to justify the current valuation.

PLTR's PE is over 600 not much more I need to say about that.

GOOG is trading at a PE of 21. Its core search business is going to be disrupted by AI but it is still entrenched and they have the time and resources to adapt. Meanwhile they own the largest streaming platform in YouTube, and arguably the most actually successful robotaxi business in Waymo. If they were ever split up the parts would be worth far more than the sum.

AAPL's heyday is behind it since their growth is anchored in devices and they will probably never acquire significantly more market share in phones meanwhile they have to create a new Fortune 500 sized business every year just to try to keep the growth going.

AMZN on the other hand is not bound by any particular industry or market. They are getting into satellites, pharmaceutical delivery, health care, and can pick any large market they want to address.

MSFT's new leadership after the atrocious Ballmer has brought the company into huge new markets and they are well positioned to capitalize on AI, with a PE of 39 they are not cheap but by far not the most expensive with solid growth prospects.

I personally think that social media is a scourge upon the earth and is destroying the minds of young and old people alike, but META has essentially monopolies that will not be disrupted. 

Meanwhile these companies are investing nearly $300 billion in cap ex per year and have returned nearly $1 trillion to shareholders in buybacks and dividends over the past 5 years. These aren't unprofitable ""dot com bubble"" stocks but entrenched cash cows. || Invest in Individual stocks of S&P 500 to beat it? If the majority of years of the S&P500 are UP

 || Is 75% Net Income spent on CAPEX too much for GOOG? In April the narrative was ""Tech is spending too much on CAPEX"". It really impacted companies like MSFT and NVDA which at the time was the right call to call that bluff.

But now, with GOOG coming out declaring it wants to spend upwards of 75% of its net income on CAPEX. Is it too much going forward?

GOOG's CAPEX has increased from a 49% average pre 2016, to a current average of 54.2% of its net income. But now it wants to spend nearly 75% for estimated 2025 Net income. And says it'll increase even more in 2026.

A bigger concern is that all this infrastructure has a high attrition rate. Servers need replacing on a 5 year cycle. So the likelihood expensive buildouts now will persist later is a problem as well.

At what point is the CAPEX expenditure too much?  || I am unimaginably dumb MSFT tanks every time after results so sold some calls before last results. Have been waiting for a 2-3% pullback to close but the mf stock is going up in straight line like some startup stock.

Position: Scaling into 1,000+ shares 
Conviction: Stronger than the LT4 torque curve
Catalyst: IP dominance in AI memory infrastructure nobody‚Äôs pricing in

üèéÔ∏è The Setup:

I sold my 2019 Sebring Orange Z06 ‚Äî 2LZ, Kalahari interior, 5,955 miles of pure sauce ‚Äî for $78K cash.

Why?

Because while everyone‚Äôs chasing gains in NVDA, AMD, and MU, I went full galaxy brain and bought the company that quietly gets paid every time those companies scale.

I didn‚Äôt just trade torque for tech.
I traded a car for compoundable alpha.



üß† What is Rambus (RMBS)?
	‚Ä¢	NOT a RAM company, it‚Äôs the patent-powered IP tollbooth for AI memory.
	‚Ä¢	Their tech fuels DDR5, HBM3, PCIe, and CXL ‚Äî aka every AI/data center ramp in progress.
	‚Ä¢	Licensing model = 80% gross margins, no debt, $500M cash, printing risk-free cash every quarter.
	‚Ä¢	No manufacturing risk, just collecting checks like a chip landlord.



üî• Technical Breakout Confirmed
	‚Ä¢	Cleared a cup-with-handle base at $63.15, broke out hard and is now pushing toward ATHs near $69‚Äì70.
	‚Ä¢	Riding above 21- and 50-day moving averages like it‚Äôs on magnetic rails.
	‚Ä¢	Relative Strength: 87
	‚Ä¢	IBD Composite Rating: 96
	‚Ä¢	EPS Rating: 99

üìâ Every technical signal says:
This thing wants to fly.

üíº Who‚Äôs Buying?

Institutions are already ahead of you:

Fund	Value Held	     Trend
BlackRock	$1.18B	      ‚Üë Increasing
Vanguard	$644M	‚Üë Increasing
T. Rowe Price	$453M	‚Üë Increasing
Invesco	$234M	       ‚Üë Increasing
Janus, Mariner, Signaturefd	+$113M in July	Just entered

Even IBD just lumped RMBS in with NVDA and AVGO on their elite ‚Äúfunds are loading‚Äù list. This ain‚Äôt some rando tech penny ‚Äî this is the next chapter of AI infrastructure.



üìÜ What‚Äôs Next?
	1.	Q2 Earnings ‚Äì July 28
	‚Ä¢	Expected: $0.58 EPS / $167M revenue
	‚Ä¢	Rambus always sandbags. Beat + raise incoming.
	2.	AI build-out tailwind
	‚Ä¢	DDR5, HBM3, CXL adoption means licensing revenue spikes.
	‚Ä¢	They‚Äôre in every next-gen memory and PCIe lane that matters.
	3.	Price Targets
	‚Ä¢	Analyst Median: $71
	‚Ä¢	Top End: $90+
	‚Ä¢	My PT: 3-digit club.
Because IP + AI = asymmetry.



üöÄ Why I‚Äôm All-In:
	‚Ä¢	Most traders buy what CNBC tells them. I buy what CNBC will eventually discover.
	‚Ä¢	NVDA gets headlines. RMBS gets checks.
	‚Ä¢	I‚Äôm not swinging for a 10% gain. I‚Äôm leveraging intellectual property in a vertical that can‚Äôt function without it.

You can keep your car. I‚Äôll take the cash flow.

NFLX,2025-07-18,US,"U.S. Pre-Market Watch Netflix Falls, Chinese E-Commerce Stocks Strengthen, Cryptocurrency Stocks Rally Again Netflix (NFLX) is down about 2.5% pre-market. There are no major headwinds at the moment, but it could be due to yesterday's slowdown in Disney+ subscription growth, coupled with concerns about ‚Äústreaming fatigue‚Äù. Some investors think the current valuation is too high, so even a slight slowdown could trigger a sell-off.

Alibaba (BABA) and Jingdong (JD) are both up more than 3% premarket. That's likely due to better-than-expected Chinese retail sales data released last night, coupled with the fact that the market is starting to envision the PBoC potentially easing further this month. Also, Ali just announced a new round of share buybacks which the market always buys.

Cryptocurrency concepts (e.g. Coinbase, Marathon, Riot) are strong again today, with Bitcoin back above $65,000. There are rumors that the SEC may expedite approval of the Ether ETF (not confirmed yet), but it's clear that the market is ‚Äúbuying expectations‚Äù again.

My take: 

I'm still bullish on Netflix over the long term, but I'm not going to chase it higher at the moment. If they can't find new growth outside of price increases and gaming, the pressure will mount.

Mid-cap stocks Risk is high, but so is the potential. If you already hold stocks like BABA or JD, this wave could be a ‚Äúsentiment inflection point‚Äù. But remember, the political risk between US and China is still there, don't ignore it.

Crypto stocks I personally don't touch unless I'm on the ultra-short side. These stocks are essentially a magnifying glass for BTC and are too volatile for retail investors.

Anyone planning on taking advantage of Netflix's pullback? Or take advantage of the rise in Chinese stocks to add to their positions?

NVDA,2025-07-20,US,"Nvidia Will Continue Controlling The AI Board Nvidia is the 'queen' of the AI ecosystem, dominating hardware, software, and systems and controlling key segments from training to inference and networking.

Unmatched AI leadership, explosive revenue growth, and strategic partnerships with players like Astera Labs, Credo, and Super Micro Computer reinforce Nvidia's central role.

China market access and the Omniverse platform provide significant new growth drivers, supporting a strong 12-24 month growth outlook and a buy rating.

Despite high absolute valuation multiples, Nvidia's rapid growth and favorable PEG ratios make it attractive versus peers; the main risk is US-China geopolitical tension.

I believe these companies are well-positioned in the AI ecosystem, but I realise that one piece is missing: the queen. Just like in a game of chess, the queen is the most powerful and versatile piece on the board. It can move in any direction (horizontal, vertical, and diagonal) and quickly cover a wide area. That is why I believe it is a perfect fit for NVIDIA (NVDA). I say this because it dominates both offensively and defensively. Just as the queen controls most of the board, NVDA controls the most valuable parts of the AI infrastructure, from training to inference, simulation, and networking. Secondly, it is versatile and critical because it spans hardware, software, and systems. This is cool because few participants can match its breadth and influence. Finally, it leverages strategic partnerships. I mean, just as the queen commands pawns, rooks, and bishops, NVDA integrates system builders (such as Super Micro Computer (SMCI)), connectivity providers (such as Credo Technology Group (CRDO) and Astera Labs (ALAB)), and government AI programmes to expand its control over the AI battlefield.

So why is the queen so special?

Well, several factors set Nvidia apart. First and foremost, it holds an unparalleled leadership position in the AI field, thanks to the combination of hardware, software, and ecosystem advantages. Its Blackwell GPU architecture makes it uniquely special. Combined with the Omniverse simulation platform, we are driving self-reinforcing AI, which is driving explosive growth. For example, in the first quarter of the 2026 fiscal year, NVDA achieved revenue of $44.1 billion, representing a year over year increase of 69%. Data centre revenue reached $39.1 billion, up 73%. Some of Nvidia's key customers such as Microsoft , Google  OpenAI, and Meta  deploy tens of thousands of Nvidia's latest GPUs each quarter. For example, according to SA Weebler Finance data, hyperscale data centre operators are running approximately 1,000 NVLink rack systems (about 72,000 GPUs) per week, with further increases expected. Ideally, this means Nvidia's data centre run rate in the AI computing sector has exceeded $170 billion annually.

Secondly, NVDA's stack is also expanding beyond GPUs. As I mentioned, its global industrial simulation platform is now being used to digitise entire factories and cities. In fact, the platform has evolved to support critical infrastructure. Original equipment manufacturers like BMW are running over 30 virtual factories on the platform to optimise production in advance. As each AI solution requires an increasing amount of synthetic training data, NVDA's end-to-end solutions form an unparalleled moat. Ideally, this platform means more users generating more simulation data, ultimately driving demand for more Nvidia computing resources. What I see is that NVDA is now at the centre of the AI value chain.

Finally, the U.S. has approved the resumption of exports of NVIDIA H20 AI GPUs to China. This means NVIDIA will be able to access China's potential market, which is significant. According to a Morgan Stanley report, China's AI market is expected to reach $1.4 trillion by 2030.

China has been systematically implementing a long-term strategy to build its domestic artificial intelligence capabilities. Its strong academic foundation, innovative methods, data, talent, and growing foreign investment are driving it toward becoming a leading artificial intelligence powerhouse...

‚Äò...China is less concerned with building the most powerful AI capabilities and more focused on bringing AI to market. China embraces open-source AI, while the United States appears to be moving toward closed, tightly controlled AI systems...‚Äô

‚Äò...The next 6 to 12 months will be a critical period for Chinese AI companies, as more and more deployments aimed at solving real-world problems begin to demonstrate productivity gains.‚Äô

Due to this milestone, NVDA's Jensen Huang estimates that NVDA's potential market size  in China will reach $50 billion. This means that China's spending on AI will increase, and Nvidia's growth prospects are expected to be stronger than ever before. I expect this growth outlook to be reflected in the upcoming quarterly earnings report to be released on 27 August 2025.

These factors combined will undoubtedly accelerate Nvidia's growth trajectory over the next 12 to 24 months. Therefore, I assign a ‚ÄòBuy‚Äô rating to Nvidia Corporation.

Nvidia's AI Ecosystem

Having highlighted the case for NVDA, I would like to connect it to some AI components I have researched previously. Some of these AI companies have remarkable growth prospects and are expected to align their growth trajectories with NVDA. Additionally, the connections between NVDA and these AI companies will help us better understand NVDA's future direction.

First, Astera Labs  is a leading connectivity chip company that recently went public in 2024. ALAB's chips support scalable and low-latency GPU rack interconnects. For more information on Astera Labs and its chips, please refer to Article 1 and Article 2. Now, Nvidia has publicly announced its collaboration with Astera on NVLink Fusion. This collaboration expands NVDA's total addressable market (TAM).

There is also Credo Technology, which is known for its active cables  re-timers, and SerDes chips. According to SA Oakoff Investments, most hyperscale computing vendors now consider CRDO's AEC to be the de facto standard for in-rack links. This means that AEC cables are the infrastructure required for NVDA's 72-GPU Blackwell rack.

Third, Super Micro Computer  and Celestica  manufacture and sell GPU racks and systems using NVDA technology. Nvidia currently provides complete data centre racks containing tens of thousands of GPUs, which are delivered to system builders like SMCI and CLS. They then collaborate with NVDA to package and sell these racks to hyperscale customers such as Microsoft, Meta, and Amazon. For more information, please refer to this article from SMCI and this article from Celestica.

In summary, these partnerships demonstrate NVIDIA's connectivity within the AI ecosystem. This confirms that NVIDIA is indeed the queen of the AI chessboard.

For a company with a market capitalisation of 4.22 trillion dollars, it still has significant growth opportunities, particularly in the Chinese market, which means there is much to watch for with NVIDIA. Additionally, I note that NVIDIA has an A- growth rating, as shown in the figure below. The company's expected revenue growth rate is 60.71%, while the industry median is 7.28%. Furthermore, its 3-5 year compound annual growth rate  for expected long-term earnings per share  growth is 29.09%, compared to the industry median of 14.29%. This clearly indicates the expected growth levels for certain potential AI opportunities, such as the Omniverse platform and the Chinese AI market.

Now, when it comes to valuation, the growth outlook is becoming clearer. First, when I look at the chart below, I notice that most metrics are above the industry median, indicating that the valuation is higher than the industry median. Its non-GAAP forward price-to-earnings ratio is 40.12 times, and its forward enterprise value to EBITDA ratio is 34.79 times, both significantly higher than the industry median. However, when I look at the non-GAAP forward price-to-earnings ratio , it indicates that the valuation is undervalued by 27%. NVDA's price-to-earnings ratio is 1.38 times, while the industry median is 1.90 times. Based on the GAAP trailing 12-month PEG, the company's P/E ratio is 0.69 times, undervalued by 31% compared to the industry median. Ideally, I would say that most multiples look high in absolute terms, but compared to NVDA's 60.71% compound annual growth rate, the stock's valuation isn't as high as it appears.

In terms of peer comparison, I chose NVDA's closest competitors because Nvidia is already far ahead in terms of market capitalisation, so I chose Broadcom and AMD. I noticed that NVDA's price-to-earnings ratio and expected price-to-earnings ratio are still lower than its peers.

I believe that the biggest risk facing NVIDIA at present is geopolitical risk. Currently, there are many uncertainties between China and the United States, especially following the imposition of tariffs on Liberation Day and the U.S. government's decision to suspend exports of H20 GPUs to China. Such situations could recur and undermine NVIDIA's growth plans and market expansion efforts. Losing the Chinese market would have a significant impact on NVIDIA's business. Additionally, geopolitical events such as trade tariffs and sanctions could affect global supply or cloud computing spending in some of the key regions where NVIDIA operates. In conclusion, in this grand AI infrastructure game, NVIDIA is the queen. Currently, it is the most powerful and flexible piece on the board. Compared to peers that may occupy other key positions, NVIDIA controls every direction. For example, AMD is the rook, SMCI is the bishop, while Credo and Astera are agile knights. Ultimately, NVIDIA determines the pace and scope of this game. As AI demand continues to grow, NVIDIA's dominant position is further strengthened by the expansion of the Chinese market. || Nvidia Will Continue Controlling The AI Board Nvidia is the 'queen' of the AI ecosystem, dominating hardware, software, and systems and controlling key segments from training to inference and networking.

China has been systematically implementing a long-term strategy to build its domestic artificial intelligence capabilities. Its strong academic foundation, innovative methods, data, talent, and growing foreign investment are driving it toward becoming a leading artificial intelligence powerhouse...

‚Äò...China is less concerned with building the most powerful AI capabilities and more focused on bringing AI to market. China embraces open-source AI, while the United States appears to be moving toward closed, tightly controlled AI systems...‚Äô

‚Äò...The next 6 to 12 months will be a critical period for Chinese AI companies, as more and more deployments aimed at solving real-world problems begin to demonstrate productivity gains.‚Äô

Due to this milestone, NVDA's Jensen Huang estimates that NVDA's potential market size  in China will reach $50 billion. This means that China's spending on AI will increase, and Nvidia's growth prospects are expected to be stronger than ever before. I expect this growth outlook to be reflected in the upcoming quarterly earnings report to be released on 27 August 2025.

These factors combined will undoubtedly accelerate Nvidia's growth trajectory over the next 12 to 24 months. Therefore, I assign a ‚ÄòBuy‚Äô rating to Nvidia Corporation.

Nvidia's AI Ecosystem

Having highlighted the case for NVDA, I would like to connect it to some AI components I have researched previously. Some of these AI companies have remarkable growth prospects and are expected to align their growth trajectories with NVDA. Additionally, the connections between NVDA and these AI companies will help us better understand NVDA's future direction.

First, Astera Labs  is a leading connectivity chip company that recently went public in 2024. ALAB's chips support scalable and low-latency GPU rack interconnects. For more information on Astera Labs and its chips, please refer to Article 1 and Article 2. Now, Nvidia has publicly announced its collaboration with Astera on NVLink Fusion. This collaboration expands NVDA's total addressable market (TAM).

There is also Credo Technology, which is known for its active cables  re-timers, and SerDes chips. According to SA Oakoff Investments, most hyperscale computing vendors now consider CRDO's AEC to be the de facto standard for in-rack links. This means that AEC cables are the infrastructure required for NVDA's 72-GPU Blackwell rack.

Third, Super Micro Computer  and Celestica  manufacture and sell GPU racks and systems using NVDA technology. Nvidia currently provides complete data centre racks containing tens of thousands of GPUs, which are delivered to system builders like SMCI and CLS. They then collaborate with NVDA to package and sell these racks to hyperscale customers such as Microsoft, Meta, and Amazon. For more information, please refer to this article from SMCI and this article from Celestica.

In summary, these partnerships demonstrate NVIDIA's connectivity within the AI ecosystem. This confirms that NVIDIA is indeed the queen of the AI chessboard.

For a company with a market capitalisation of 4.22 trillion dollars, it still has significant growth opportunities, particularly in the Chinese market, which means there is much to watch for with NVIDIA. Additionally, I note that NVIDIA has an A- growth rating, as shown in the figure below. The company's expected revenue growth rate is 60.71%, while the industry median is 7.28%. Furthermore, its 3-5 year compound annual growth rate  for expected long-term earnings per share  growth is 29.09%, compared to the industry median of 14.29%. This clearly indicates the expected growth levels for certain potential AI opportunities, such as the Omniverse platform and the Chinese AI market.

Now, when it comes to valuation, the growth outlook is becoming clearer. First, when I look at the chart below, I notice that most metrics are above the industry median, indicating that the valuation is higher than the industry median. Its non-GAAP forward price-to-earnings ratio is 40.12 times, and its forward enterprise value to EBITDA ratio is 34.79 times, both significantly higher than the industry median. However, when I look at the non-GAAP forward price-to-earnings ratio , it indicates that the valuation is undervalued by 27%. NVDA's price-to-earnings ratio is 1.38 times, while the industry median is 1.90 times. Based on the GAAP trailing 12-month PEG, the company's P/E ratio is 0.69 times, undervalued by 31% compared to the industry median. Ideally, I would say that most multiples look high in absolute terms, but compared to NVDA's 60.71% compound annual growth rate, the stock's valuation isn't as high as it appears.

In terms of peer comparison, I chose NVDA's closest competitors because Nvidia is already far ahead in terms of market capitalisation, so I chose Broadcom and AMD. I noticed that NVDA's price-to-earnings ratio and expected price-to-earnings ratio are still lower than its peers.

I believe that the biggest risk facing NVIDIA at present is geopolitical risk. Currently, there are many uncertainties between China and the United States, especially following the imposition of tariffs on Liberation Day and the U.S. government's decision to suspend exports of H20 GPUs to China. Such situations could recur and undermine NVIDIA's growth plans and market expansion efforts. Losing the Chinese market would have a significant impact on NVIDIA's business. Additionally, geopolitical events such as trade tariffs and sanctions could affect global supply or cloud computing spending in some of the key regions where NVIDIA operates. In conclusion, in this grand AI infrastructure game, NVIDIA is the queen. Currently, it is the most powerful and flexible piece on the board. Compared to peers that may occupy other key positions, NVIDIA controls every direction. For example, AMD is the rook, SMCI is the bishop, while Credo and Astera are agile knights. Ultimately, NVIDIA determines the pace and scope of this game. As AI demand continues to grow, NVIDIA's dominant position is further strengthened by the expansion of the Chinese market. || Nvidia Will Continue Controlling The AI Board Nvidia is the 'queen' of the AI ecosystem, dominating hardware, software, and systems and controlling key segments from training to inference and networking.

Unmatched AI leadership, explosive revenue growth, and strategic partnerships with players like Astera Labs, Credo, and Super Micro Computer reinforce Nvidia's central role.

China market access and the Omniverse platform provide significant new growth drivers, supporting a strong 12-24 month growth outlook and a buy rating.

Despite high absolute valuation multiples, Nvidia's rapid growth and favorable PEG ratios make it attractive versus peers; the main risk is US-China geopolitical tension.

I believe these companies are well-positioned in the AI ecosystem, but I realise that one piece is missing: the queen. Just like in a game of chess, the queen is the most powerful and versatile piece on the board. It can move in any direction (horizontal, vertical, and diagonal) and quickly cover a wide area. That is why I believe it is a perfect fit for NVIDIA (NVDA). I say this because it dominates both offensively and defensively. Just as the queen controls most of the board, NVDA controls the most valuable parts of the AI infrastructure, from training to inference, simulation, and networking. Secondly, it is versatile and critical because it spans hardware, software, and systems. This is cool because few participants can match its breadth and influence. Finally, it leverages strategic partnerships. I mean, just as the queen commands pawns, rooks, and bishops, NVDA integrates system builders (such as Super Micro Computer (SMCI)), connectivity providers (such as Credo Technology Group (CRDO) and Astera Labs (ALAB)), and government AI programmes to expand its control over the AI battlefield.

So why is the queen so special?

Well, several factors set Nvidia apart. First and foremost, it holds an unparalleled leadership position in the AI field, thanks to the combination of hardware, software, and ecosystem advantages. Its Blackwell GPU architecture makes it uniquely special. Combined with the Omniverse simulation platform, we are driving self-reinforcing AI, which is driving explosive growth. For example, in the first quarter of the 2026 fiscal year, NVDA achieved revenue of $44.1 billion, representing a year over year increase of 69%. Data centre revenue reached $39.1 billion, up 73%. Some of Nvidia's key customers such as Microsoft , Google  OpenAI, and Meta  deploy tens of thousands of Nvidia's latest GPUs each quarter. For example, according to SA Weebler Finance data, hyperscale data centre operators are running approximately 1,000 NVLink rack systems (about 72,000 GPUs) per week, with further increases expected. Ideally, this means Nvidia's data centre run rate in the AI computing sector has exceeded $170 billion annually.

Secondly, NVDA's stack is also expanding beyond GPUs. As I mentioned, its global industrial simulation platform is now being used to digitise entire factories and cities. In fact, the platform has evolved to support critical infrastructure. Original equipment manufacturers like BMW are running over 30 virtual factories on the platform to optimise production in advance. As each AI solution requires an increasing amount of synthetic training data, NVDA's end-to-end solutions form an unparalleled moat. Ideally, this platform means more users generating more simulation data, ultimately driving demand for more Nvidia computing resources. What I see is that NVDA is now at the centre of the AI value chain.

Finally, the U.S. has approved the resumption of exports of NVIDIA H20 AI GPUs to China. This means NVIDIA will be able to access China's potential market, which is significant. According to a Morgan Stanley report, China's AI market is expected to reach $1.4 trillion by 2030.

As AI demand continues to grow, NVIDIA's dominant position is further strengthened by the expansion of the Chinese market. || Nvidia Will Continue Controlling The AI Board Nvidia is the 'queen' of the AI ecosystem, dominating hardware, software, and systems and controlling key segments from training to inference and networking.

Unmatched AI leadership, explosive revenue growth, and strategic partnerships with players like Astera Labs, Credo, and Super Micro Computer reinforce Nvidia's central role.

China market access and the Omniverse platform provide significant new growth drivers, supporting a strong 12-24 month growth outlook and a buy rating.

Despite high absolute valuation multiples, Nvidia's rapid growth and favorable PEG ratios make it attractive versus peers; the main risk is US-China geopolitical tension.

I believe these companies are well-positioned in the AI ecosystem, but I realise that one piece is missing: the queen. Just like in a game of chess, the queen is the most powerful and versatile piece on the board. It can move in any direction (horizontal, vertical, and diagonal) and quickly cover a wide area. That is why I believe it is a perfect fit for NVIDIA (NVDA). I say this because it dominates both offensively and defensively. Just as the queen controls most of the board, NVDA controls the most valuable parts of the AI infrastructure, from training to inference, simulation, and networking. Secondly, it is versatile and critical because it spans hardware, software, and systems. This is cool because few participants can match its breadth and influence. Finally, it leverages strategic partnerships. I mean, just as the queen commands pawns, rooks, and bishops, NVDA integrates system builders (such as Super Micro Computer (SMCI)), connectivity providers (such as Credo Technology Group (CRDO) and Astera Labs (ALAB)), and government AI programmes to expand its control over the AI battlefield.

So why is the queen so special?

Well, several factors set Nvidia apart. First and foremost, it holds an unparalleled leadership position in the AI field, thanks to the combination of hardware, software, and ecosystem advantages. Its Blackwell GPU architecture makes it uniquely special. Combined with the Omniverse simulation platform, we are driving self-reinforcing AI, which is driving explosive growth. For example, in the first quarter of the 2026 fiscal year, NVDA achieved revenue of $44.1 billion, representing a year over year increase of 69%. Data centre revenue reached $39.1 billion, up 73%. Some of Nvidia's key customers such as Microsoft , Google  OpenAI, and Meta  deploy tens of thousands of Nvidia's latest GPUs each quarter. For example, according to SA Weebler Finance data, hyperscale data centre operators are running approximately 1,000 NVLink rack systems (about 72,000 GPUs) per week, with further increases expected. Ideally, this means Nvidia's data centre run rate in the AI computing sector has exceeded $170 billion annually.

Secondly, NVDA's stack is also expanding beyond GPUs. As I mentioned, its global industrial simulation platform is now being used to digitise entire factories and cities. In fact, the platform has evolved to support critical infrastructure. Original equipment manufacturers like BMW are running over 30 virtual factories on the platform to optimise production in advance. As each AI solution requires an increasing amount of synthetic training data, NVDA's end-to-end solutions form an unparalleled moat. Ideally, this platform means more users generating more simulation data, ultimately driving demand for more Nvidia computing resources. What I see is that NVDA is now at the centre of the AI value chain.

Finally, the U.S. has approved the resumption of exports of NVIDIA H20 AI GPUs to China. This means NVIDIA will be able to access China's potential market, which is significant. According to a Morgan Stanley report, China's AI market is expected to reach $1.4 trillion by 2030.

China has been systematically implementing a long-term strategy to build its domestic artificial intelligence capabilities. Its strong academic foundation, innovative methods, data, talent, and growing foreign investment are driving it toward becoming a leading artificial intelligence powerhouse...

‚Äò...China is less concerned with building the most powerful AI capabilities and more focused on bringing AI to market. China embraces open-source AI, while the United States appears to be moving toward closed, tightly controlled AI systems...‚Äô

‚Äò...The next 6 to 12 months will be a critical period for Chinese AI companies, as more and more deployments aimed at solving real-world problems begin to demonstrate productivity gains.‚Äô

Due to this milestone, NVDA's Jensen Huang estimates that NVDA's potential market size  in China will reach $50 billion. This means that China's spending on AI will increase, and Nvidia's growth prospects are expected to be stronger than ever before. I expect this growth outlook to be reflected in the upcoming quarterly earnings report to be released on 27 August 2025.

These factors combined will undoubtedly accelerate Nvidia's growth trajectory over the next 12 to 24 months. Therefore, I assign a ‚ÄòBuy‚Äô rating to Nvidia Corporation.

Nvidia's AI Ecosystem

Having highlighted the case for NVDA, I would like to connect it to some AI components I have researched previously. Some of these AI companies have remarkable growth prospects and are expected to align their growth trajectories with NVDA. Additionally, the connections between NVDA and these AI companies will help us better understand NVDA's future direction.

First, Astera Labs  is a leading connectivity chip company that recently went public in 2024. ALAB's chips support scalable and low-latency GPU rack interconnects. For more information on Astera Labs and its chips, please refer to Article 1 and Article 2. Now, Nvidia has publicly announced its collaboration with Astera on NVLink Fusion. This collaboration expands NVDA's total addressable market (TAM).

There is also Credo Technology, which is known for its active cables  re-timers, and SerDes chips. According to SA Oakoff Investments, most hyperscale computing vendors now consider CRDO's AEC to be the de facto standard for in-rack links. This means that AEC cables are the infrastructure required for NVDA's 72-GPU Blackwell rack.

Third, Super Micro Computer  and Celestica  manufacture and sell GPU racks and systems using NVDA technology. Nvidia currently provides complete data centre racks containing tens of thousands of GPUs, which are delivered to system builders like SMCI and CLS. They then collaborate with NVDA to package and sell these racks to hyperscale customers such as Microsoft, Meta, and Amazon. For more information, please refer to this article from SMCI and this article from Celestica.

In summary, these partnerships demonstrate NVIDIA's connectivity within the AI ecosystem. This confirms that NVIDIA is indeed the queen of the AI chessboard.

For a company with a market capitalisation of 4.22 trillion dollars, it still has significant growth opportunities, particularly in the Chinese market, which means there is much to watch for with NVIDIA. Additionally, I note that NVIDIA has an A- growth rating, as shown in the figure below. The company's expected revenue growth rate is 60.71%, while the industry median is 7.28%. Furthermore, its 3-5 year compound annual growth rate  for expected long-term earnings per share  growth is 29.09%, compared to the industry median of 14.29%. This clearly indicates the expected growth levels for certain potential AI opportunities, such as the Omniverse platform and the Chinese AI market.

Now, when it comes to valuation, the growth outlook is becoming clearer. First, when I look at the chart below, I notice that most metrics are above the industry median, indicating that the valuation is higher than the industry median. Its non-GAAP forward price-to-earnings ratio is 40.12 times, and its forward enterprise value to EBITDA ratio is 34.79 times, both significantly higher than the industry median. However, when I look at the non-GAAP forward price-to-earnings ratio , it indicates that the valuation is undervalued by 27%. NVDA's price-to-earnings ratio is 1.38 times, while the industry median is 1.90 times. Based on the GAAP trailing 12-month PEG, the company's P/E ratio is 0.69 times, undervalued by 31% compared to the industry median. Ideally, I would say that most multiples look high in absolute terms, but compared to NVDA's 60.71% compound annual growth rate, the stock's valuation isn't as high as it appears.

In terms of peer comparison, I chose NVDA's closest competitors because Nvidia is already far ahead in terms of market capitalisation, so I chose Broadcom and AMD. I noticed that NVDA's price-to-earnings ratio and expected price-to-earnings ratio are still lower than its peers.

I believe that the biggest risk facing NVIDIA at present is geopolitical risk. Currently, there are many uncertainties between China and the United States, especially following the imposition of tariffs on Liberation Day and the U.S. government's decision to suspend exports of H20 GPUs to China. Such situations could recur and undermine NVIDIA's growth plans and market expansion efforts. Losing the Chinese market would have a significant impact on NVIDIA's business. Additionally, geopolitical events such as trade tariffs and sanctions could affect global supply or cloud computing spending in some of the key regions where NVIDIA operates. In conclusion, in this grand AI infrastructure game, NVIDIA is the queen. Currently, it is the most powerful and flexible piece on the board. Compared to peers that may occupy other key positions, NVIDIA controls every direction. For example, AMD is the rook, SMCI is the bishop, while Credo and Astera are agile knights. Ultimately, NVIDIA determines the pace and scope of this game. As AI demand continues to grow, NVIDIA's dominant position is further strengthened by the expansion of the Chinese market. || Nvidia Will Continue Controlling The AI Board Nvidia is the 'queen' of the AI ecosystem, dominating hardware, software, and systems and controlling key segments from training to inference and networking.

This means that AEC cables are the infrastructure required for NVDA's 72-GPU Blackwell rack.

Third, Super Micro Computer  and Celestica  manufacture and sell GPU racks and systems using NVDA technology. Nvidia currently provides complete data centre racks containing tens of thousands of GPUs, which are delivered to system builders like SMCI and CLS. They then collaborate with NVDA to package and sell these racks to hyperscale customers such as Microsoft, Meta, and Amazon. For more information, please refer to this article from SMCI and this article from Celestica.

In summary, these partnerships demonstrate NVIDIA's connectivity within the AI ecosystem. This confirms that NVIDIA is indeed the queen of the AI chessboard.

For a company with a market capitalisation of 4.22 trillion dollars, it still has significant growth opportunities, particularly in the Chinese market, which means there is much to watch for with NVIDIA. Additionally, I note that NVIDIA has an A- growth rating, as shown in the figure below. The company's expected revenue growth rate is 60.71%, while the industry median is 7.28%. Furthermore, its 3-5 year compound annual growth rate  for expected long-term earnings per share  growth is 29.09%, compared to the industry median of 14.29%. This clearly indicates the expected growth levels for certain potential AI opportunities, such as the Omniverse platform and the Chinese AI market.

Now, when it comes to valuation, the growth outlook is becoming clearer. First, when I look at the chart below, I notice that most metrics are above the industry median, indicating that the valuation is higher than the industry median. Its non-GAAP forward price-to-earnings ratio is 40.12 times, and its forward enterprise value to EBITDA ratio is 34.79 times, both significantly higher than the industry median. However, when I look at the non-GAAP forward price-to-earnings ratio , it indicates that the valuation is undervalued by 27%. NVDA's price-to-earnings ratio is 1.38 times, while the industry median is 1.90 times. Based on the GAAP trailing 12-month PEG, the company's P/E ratio is 0.69 times, undervalued by 31% compared to the industry median. Ideally, I would say that most multiples look high in absolute terms, but compared to NVDA's 60.71% compound annual growth rate, the stock's valuation isn't as high as it appears.

In terms of peer comparison, I chose NVDA's closest competitors because Nvidia is already far ahead in terms of market capitalisation, so I chose Broadcom and AMD. I noticed that NVDA's price-to-earnings ratio and expected price-to-earnings ratio are still lower than its peers.

I believe that the biggest risk facing NVIDIA at present is geopolitical risk. Currently, there are many uncertainties between China and the United States, especially following the imposition of tariffs on Liberation Day and the U.S. government's decision to suspend exports of H20 GPUs to China. Such situations could recur and undermine NVIDIA's growth plans and market expansion efforts. Losing the Chinese market would have a significant impact on NVIDIA's business. Additionally, geopolitical events such as trade tariffs and sanctions could affect global supply or cloud computing spending in some of the key regions where NVIDIA operates. In conclusion, in this grand AI infrastructure game, NVIDIA is the queen. Currently, it is the most powerful and flexible piece on the board. Compared to peers that may occupy other key positions, NVIDIA controls every direction. For example, AMD is the rook, SMCI is the bishop, while Credo and Astera are agile knights. Ultimately, NVIDIA determines the pace and scope of this game. As AI demand continues to grow, NVIDIA's dominant position is further strengthened by the expansion of the Chinese market. || Nvidia Will Continue Controlling The AI Board Nvidia is the 'queen' of the AI ecosystem, dominating hardware, software, and systems and controlling key segments from training to inference and networking.

Unmatched AI leadership, explosive revenue growth, and strategic partnerships with players like Astera Labs, Credo, and Super Micro Computer reinforce Nvidia's central role.

China market access and the Omniverse platform provide significant new growth drivers, supporting a strong 12-24 month growth outlook and a buy rating.

Despite high absolute valuation multiples, Nvidia's rapid growth and favorable PEG ratios make it attractive versus peers; the main risk is US-China geopolitical tension.

I believe these companies are well-positioned in the AI ecosystem, but I realise that one piece is missing: the queen. Just like in a game of chess, the queen is the most powerful and versatile piece on the board. It can move in any direction (horizontal, vertical, and diagonal) and quickly cover a wide area. That is why I believe it is a perfect fit for NVIDIA (NVDA). I say this because it dominates both offensively and defensively. Just as the queen controls most of the board, NVDA controls the most valuable parts of the AI infrastructure, from training to inference, simulation, and networking. Secondly, it is versatile and critical because it spans hardware, software, and systems. This is cool because few participants can match its breadth and influence. Finally, it leverages strategic partnerships. I mean, just as the queen commands pawns, rooks, and bishops, NVDA integrates system builders (such as Super Micro Computer (SMCI)), connectivity providers (such as Credo Technology Group (CRDO) and Astera Labs (ALAB)), and government AI programmes to expand its control over the AI battlefield.

So why is the queen so special?

Well, several factors set Nvidia apart. First and foremost, it holds an unparalleled leadership position in the AI field, thanks to the combination of hardware, software, and ecosystem advantages. Its Blackwell GPU architecture makes it uniquely special. Combined with the Omniverse simulation platform, we are driving self-reinforcing AI, which is driving explosive growth. For example, in the first quarter of the 2026 fiscal year, NVDA achieved revenue of $44.1 billion, representing a year over year increase of 69%. Data centre revenue reached $39.1 billion, up 73%. Some of Nvidia's key customers such as Microsoft , Google  OpenAI, and Meta  deploy tens of thousands of Nvidia's latest GPUs each quarter. For example, according to SA Weebler Finance data, hyperscale data centre operators are running approximately 1,000 NVLink rack systems (about 72,000 GPUs) per week, with further increases expected. Ideally, this means Nvidia's data centre run rate in the AI computing sector has exceeded $170 billion annually.

Secondly, NVDA's stack is also expanding beyond GPUs. As I mentioned, its global industrial simulation platform is now being used to digitise entire factories and cities. In fact, the platform has evolved to support critical infrastructure. Original equipment manufacturers like BMW are running over 30 virtual factories on the platform to optimise production in advance. As each AI solution requires an increasing amount of synthetic training data, NVDA's end-to-end solutions form an unparalleled moat. Ideally, this platform means more users generating more simulation data, ultimately driving demand for more Nvidia computing resources. What I see is that NVDA is now at the centre of the AI value chain.

Finally, the U.S. has approved the resumption of exports of NVIDIA H20 AI GPUs to China. This means NVIDIA will be able to access China's potential market, which is significant. According to a Morgan Stanley report, China's AI market is expected to reach $1.4 trillion by 2030.

China has been systematically implementing a long-term strategy to build its domestic artificial intelligence capabilities. Its strong academic foundation, innovative methods, data, talent, and growing foreign investment are driving it toward becoming a leading artificial intelligence powerhouse...

‚Äò...China is less concerned with building the most powerful AI capabilities and more focused on bringing AI to market. China embraces open-source AI, while the United States appears to be moving toward closed, tightly controlled AI systems...‚Äô

‚Äò...The next 6 to 12 months will be a critical period for Chinese AI companies, as more and more deployments aimed at solving real-world problems begin to demonstrate productivity gains.‚Äô

Due to this milestone, NVDA's Jensen Huang estimates that NVDA's potential market size  in China will reach $50 billion. This means that China's spending on AI will increase, and Nvidia's growth prospects are expected to be stronger than ever before. I expect this growth outlook to be reflected in the upcoming quarterly earnings report to be released on 27 August 2025.

These factors combined will undoubtedly accelerate Nvidia's growth trajectory over the next 12 to 24 months. Therefore, I assign a ‚ÄòBuy‚Äô rating to Nvidia Corporation.

Nvidia's AI Ecosystem

Having highlighted the case for NVDA, I would like to connect it to some AI components I have researched previously. Some of these AI companies have remarkable growth prospects and are expected to align their growth trajectories with NVDA. Additionally, the connections between NVDA and these AI companies will help us better understand NVDA's future direction.

First, Astera Labs  is a leading connectivity chip company that recently went public in 2024. ALAB's chips support scalable and low-latency GPU rack interconnects. For more information on Astera Labs and its chips, please refer to Article 1 and Article 2. Now, Nvidia has publicly announced its collaboration with Astera on NVLink Fusion. This collaboration expands NVDA's total addressable market (TAM).

There is also Credo Technology, which is known for its active cables  re-timers, and SerDes chips. According to SA Oakoff Investments, most hyperscale computing vendors now consider CRDO's AEC to be the de facto standard for in-rack links. This means that AEC cables are the infrastructure required for NVDA's 72-GPU Blackwell rack.

Some of Nvidia's key customers such as Microsoft , Google  OpenAI, and Meta  deploy tens of thousands of Nvidia's latest GPUs each quarter. For example, according to SA Weebler Finance data, hyperscale data centre operators are running approximately 1,000 NVLink rack systems (about 72,000 GPUs) per week, with further increases expected. Ideally, this means Nvidia's data centre run rate in the AI computing sector has exceeded $170 billion annually.

Secondly, NVDA's stack is also expanding beyond GPUs. As I mentioned, its global industrial simulation platform is now being used to digitise entire factories and cities. In fact, the platform has evolved to support critical infrastructure. Original equipment manufacturers like BMW are running over 30 virtual factories on the platform to optimise production in advance. As each AI solution requires an increasing amount of synthetic training data, NVDA's end-to-end solutions form an unparalleled moat. Ideally, this platform means more users generating more simulation data, ultimately driving demand for more Nvidia computing resources. What I see is that NVDA is now at the centre of the AI value chain.

Finally, the U.S. has approved the resumption of exports of NVIDIA H20 AI GPUs to China. This means NVIDIA will be able to access China's potential market, which is significant. According to a Morgan Stanley report, China's AI market is expected to reach $1.4 trillion by 2030.

China has been systematically implementing a long-term strategy to build its domestic artificial intelligence capabilities. Its strong academic foundation, innovative methods, data, talent, and growing foreign investment are driving it toward becoming a leading artificial intelligence powerhouse...

‚Äò...China is less concerned with building the most powerful AI capabilities and more focused on bringing AI to market. China embraces open-source AI, while the United States appears to be moving toward closed, tightly controlled AI systems...‚Äô

‚Äò...The next 6 to 12 months will be a critical period for Chinese AI companies, as more and more deployments aimed at solving real-world problems begin to demonstrate productivity gains.‚Äô

Due to this milestone, NVDA's Jensen Huang estimates that NVDA's potential market size  in China will reach $50 billion. This means that China's spending on AI will increase, and Nvidia's growth prospects are expected to be stronger than ever before. I expect this growth outlook to be reflected in the upcoming quarterly earnings report to be released on 27 August 2025.

These factors combined will undoubtedly accelerate Nvidia's growth trajectory over the next 12 to 24 months. Therefore, I assign a ‚ÄòBuy‚Äô rating to Nvidia Corporation.

Nvidia's AI Ecosystem

Having highlighted the case for NVDA, I would like to connect it to some AI components I have researched previously. Some of these AI companies have remarkable growth prospects and are expected to align their growth trajectories with NVDA. Additionally, the connections between NVDA and these AI companies will help us better understand NVDA's future direction.

First, Astera Labs  is a leading connectivity chip company that recently went public in 2024. ALAB's chips support scalable and low-latency GPU rack interconnects. For more information on Astera Labs and its chips, please refer to Article 1 and Article 2. Now, Nvidia has publicly announced its collaboration with Astera on NVLink Fusion. This collaboration expands NVDA's total addressable market (TAM).

There is also Credo Technology, which is known for its active cables  re-timers, and SerDes chips. According to SA Oakoff Investments, most hyperscale computing vendors now consider CRDO's AEC to be the de facto standard for in-rack links. This means that AEC cables are the infrastructure required for NVDA's 72-GPU Blackwell rack.

Third, Super Micro Computer  and Celestica  manufacture and sell GPU racks and systems using NVDA technology. Nvidia currently provides complete data centre racks containing tens of thousands of GPUs, which are delivered to system builders like SMCI and CLS. They then collaborate with NVDA to package and sell these racks to hyperscale customers such as Microsoft, Meta, and Amazon. For more information, please refer to this article from SMCI and this article from Celestica.

In summary, these partnerships demonstrate NVIDIA's connectivity within the AI ecosystem. This confirms that NVIDIA is indeed the queen of the AI chessboard.

For a company with a market capitalisation of 4.22 trillion dollars, it still has significant growth opportunities, particularly in the Chinese market, which means there is much to watch for with NVIDIA. Additionally, I note that NVIDIA has an A- growth rating, as shown in the figure below. The company's expected revenue growth rate is 60.71%, while the industry median is 7.28%. Furthermore, its 3-5 year compound annual growth rate  for expected long-term earnings per share  growth is 29.09%, compared to the industry median of 14.29%. This clearly indicates the expected growth levels for certain potential AI opportunities, such as the Omniverse platform and the Chinese AI market.

Now, when it comes to valuation, the growth outlook is becoming clearer. First, when I look at the chart below, I notice that most metrics are above the industry median, indicating that the valuation is higher than the industry median. Its non-GAAP forward price-to-earnings ratio is 40.12 times, and its forward enterprise value to EBITDA ratio is 34.79 times, both significantly higher than the industry median. However, when I look at the non-GAAP forward price-to-earnings ratio , it indicates that the valuation is undervalued by 27%. NVDA's price-to-earnings ratio is 1.38 times, while the industry median is 1.90 times. Based on the GAAP trailing 12-month PEG, the company's P/E ratio is 0.69 times, undervalued by 31% compared to the industry median. Ideally, I would say that most multiples look high in absolute terms, but compared to NVDA's 60.71% compound annual growth rate, the stock's valuation isn't as high as it appears.

In terms of peer comparison, I chose NVDA's closest competitors because Nvidia is already far ahead in terms of market capitalisation, so I chose Broadcom and AMD. I noticed that NVDA's price-to-earnings ratio and expected price-to-earnings ratio are still lower than its peers.

I believe that the biggest risk facing NVIDIA at present is geopolitical risk. Currently, there are many uncertainties between China and the United States, especially following the imposition of tariffs on Liberation Day and the U.S. government's decision to suspend exports of H20 GPUs to China. Such situations could recur and undermine NVIDIA's growth plans and market expansion efforts. Losing the Chinese market would have a significant impact on NVIDIA's business. Additionally, geopolitical events such as trade tariffs and sanctions could affect global supply or cloud computing spending in some of the key regions where NVIDIA operates. In conclusion, in this grand AI infrastructure game, NVIDIA is the queen. Currently, it is the most powerful and flexible piece on the board. Compared to peers that may occupy other key positions, NVIDIA controls every direction. For example, AMD is the rook, SMCI is the bishop, while Credo and Astera are agile knights. Ultimately, NVIDIA determines the pace and scope of this game. As AI demand continues to grow, NVIDIA's dominant position is further strengthened by the expansion of the Chinese market. || Nvidia Will Continue Controlling The AI Board Nvidia is the 'queen' of the AI ecosystem, dominating hardware, software, and systems and controlling key segments from training to inference and networking.

Unmatched AI leadership, explosive revenue growth, and strategic partnerships with players like Astera Labs, Credo, and Super Micro Computer reinforce Nvidia's central role.

China market access and the Omniverse platform provide significant new growth drivers, supporting a strong 12-24 month growth outlook and a buy rating.

Despite high absolute valuation multiples, Nvidia's rapid growth and favorable PEG ratios make it attractive versus peers; the main risk is US-China geopolitical tension.

I believe these companies are well-positioned in the AI ecosystem, but I realise that one piece is missing: the queen. Just like in a game of chess, the queen is the most powerful and versatile piece on the board. It can move in any direction (horizontal, vertical, and diagonal) and quickly cover a wide area. That is why I believe it is a perfect fit for NVIDIA (NVDA). I say this because it dominates both offensively and defensively. Just as the queen controls most of the board, NVDA controls the most valuable parts of the AI infrastructure, from training to inference, simulation, and networking. Secondly, it is versatile and critical because it spans hardware, software, and systems. This is cool because few participants can match its breadth and influence. Finally, it leverages strategic partnerships. I mean, just as the queen commands pawns, rooks, and bishops, NVDA integrates system builders (such as Super Micro Computer (SMCI)), connectivity providers (such as Credo Technology Group (CRDO) and Astera Labs (ALAB)), and government AI programmes to expand its control over the AI battlefield.

So why is the queen so special?

Well, several factors set Nvidia apart. First and foremost, it holds an unparalleled leadership position in the AI field, thanks to the combination of hardware, software, and ecosystem advantages. Its Blackwell GPU architecture makes it uniquely special. Combined with the Omniverse simulation platform, we are driving self-reinforcing AI, which is driving explosive growth. For example, in the first quarter of the 2026 fiscal year, NVDA achieved revenue of $44.1 billion, representing a year over year increase of 69%. Data centre revenue reached $39.1 billion, up 73%.

Based on the GAAP trailing 12-month PEG, the company's P/E ratio is 0.69 times, undervalued by 31% compared to the industry median. Ideally, I would say that most multiples look high in absolute terms, but compared to NVDA's 60.71% compound annual growth rate, the stock's valuation isn't as high as it appears.

In terms of peer comparison, I chose NVDA's closest competitors because Nvidia is already far ahead in terms of market capitalisation, so I chose Broadcom and AMD. I noticed that NVDA's price-to-earnings ratio and expected price-to-earnings ratio are still lower than its peers.

I believe that the biggest risk facing NVIDIA at present is geopolitical risk. Currently, there are many uncertainties between China and the United States, especially following the imposition of tariffs on Liberation Day and the U.S. government's decision to suspend exports of H20 GPUs to China. Such situations could recur and undermine NVIDIA's growth plans and market expansion efforts. Losing the Chinese market would have a significant impact on NVIDIA's business. Additionally, geopolitical events such as trade tariffs and sanctions could affect global supply or cloud computing spending in some of the key regions where NVIDIA operates. In conclusion, in this grand AI infrastructure game, NVIDIA is the queen. Currently, it is the most powerful and flexible piece on the board. Compared to peers that may occupy other key positions, NVIDIA controls every direction. For example, AMD is the rook, SMCI is the bishop, while Credo and Astera are agile knights. Ultimately, NVIDIA determines the pace and scope of this game. As AI demand continues to grow, NVIDIA's dominant position is further strengthened by the expansion of the Chinese market. || Nvidia Will Continue Controlling The AI Board Nvidia is the 'queen' of the AI ecosystem, dominating hardware, software, and systems and controlling key segments from training to inference and networking.

Unmatched AI leadership, explosive revenue growth, and strategic partnerships with players like Astera Labs, Credo, and Super Micro Computer reinforce Nvidia's central role.

China market access and the Omniverse platform provide significant new growth drivers, supporting a strong 12-24 month growth outlook and a buy rating.

Despite high absolute valuation multiples, Nvidia's rapid growth and favorable PEG ratios make it attractive versus peers; the main risk is US-China geopolitical tension.

I believe these companies are well-positioned in the AI ecosystem, but I realise that one piece is missing: the queen. Just like in a game of chess, the queen is the most powerful and versatile piece on the board. It can move in any direction (horizontal, vertical, and diagonal) and quickly cover a wide area. That is why I believe it is a perfect fit for NVIDIA (NVDA). I say this because it dominates both offensively and defensively. Just as the queen controls most of the board, NVDA controls the most valuable parts of the AI infrastructure, from training to inference, simulation, and networking. Secondly, it is versatile and critical because it spans hardware, software, and systems. This is cool because few participants can match its breadth and influence. Finally, it leverages strategic partnerships. I mean, just as the queen commands pawns, rooks, and bishops, NVDA integrates system builders (such as Super Micro Computer (SMCI)), connectivity providers (such as Credo Technology Group (CRDO) and Astera Labs (ALAB)), and government AI programmes to expand its control over the AI battlefield.

So why is the queen so special?

Well, several factors set Nvidia apart. First and foremost, it holds an unparalleled leadership position in the AI field, thanks to the combination of hardware, software, and ecosystem advantages. Its Blackwell GPU architecture makes it uniquely special. Combined with the Omniverse simulation platform, we are driving self-reinforcing AI, which is driving explosive growth. For example, in the first quarter of the 2026 fiscal year, NVDA achieved revenue of $44.1 billion, representing a year over year increase of 69%. Data centre revenue reached $39.1 billion, up 73%. Some of Nvidia's key customers such as Microsoft , Google  OpenAI, and Meta  deploy tens of thousands of Nvidia's latest GPUs each quarter. For example, according to SA Weebler Finance data, hyperscale data centre operators are running approximately 1,000 NVLink rack systems (about 72,000 GPUs) per week, with further increases expected. Ideally, this means Nvidia's data centre run rate in the AI computing sector has exceeded $170 billion annually.

Secondly, NVDA's stack is also expanding beyond GPUs. As I mentioned, its global industrial simulation platform is now being used to digitise entire factories and cities. In fact, the platform has evolved to support critical infrastructure. Original equipment manufacturers like BMW are running over 30 virtual factories on the platform to optimise production in advance. As each AI solution requires an increasing amount of synthetic training data, NVDA's end-to-end solutions form an unparalleled moat. Ideally, this platform means more users generating more simulation data, ultimately driving demand for more Nvidia computing resources. What I see is that NVDA is now at the centre of the AI value chain.

Finally, the U.S. has approved the resumption of exports of NVIDIA H20 AI GPUs to China. This means NVIDIA will be able to access China's potential market, which is significant. According to a Morgan Stanley report, China's AI market is expected to reach $1.4 trillion by 2030.

China has been systematically implementing a long-term strategy to build its domestic artificial intelligence capabilities. Its strong academic foundation, innovative methods, data, talent, and growing foreign investment are driving it toward becoming a leading artificial intelligence powerhouse...

‚Äò...China is less concerned with building the most powerful AI capabilities and more focused on bringing AI to market. China embraces open-source AI, while the United States appears to be moving toward closed, tightly controlled AI systems...‚Äô

‚Äò...The next 6 to 12 months will be a critical period for Chinese AI companies, as more and more deployments aimed at solving real-world problems begin to demonstrate productivity gains.‚Äô

Due to this milestone, NVDA's Jensen Huang estimates that NVDA's potential market size  in China will reach $50 billion. This means that China's spending on AI will increase, and Nvidia's growth prospects are expected to be stronger than ever before. I expect this growth outlook to be reflected in the upcoming quarterly earnings report to be released on 27 August 2025.

These factors combined will undoubtedly accelerate Nvidia's growth trajectory over the next 12 to 24 months. Therefore, I assign a ‚ÄòBuy‚Äô rating to Nvidia Corporation.

Nvidia's AI Ecosystem

Having highlighted the case for NVDA, I would like to connect it to some AI components I have researched previously. Some of these AI companies have remarkable growth prospects and are expected to align their growth trajectories with NVDA. Additionally, the connections between NVDA and these AI companies will help us better understand NVDA's future direction.

First, Astera Labs  is a leading connectivity chip company that recently went public in 2024. ALAB's chips support scalable and low-latency GPU rack interconnects. For more information on Astera Labs and its chips, please refer to Article 1 and Article 2. Now, Nvidia has publicly announced its collaboration with Astera on NVLink Fusion. This collaboration expands NVDA's total addressable market (TAM).

There is also Credo Technology, which is known for its active cables  re-timers, and SerDes chips. According to SA Oakoff Investments, most hyperscale computing vendors now consider CRDO's AEC to be the de facto standard for in-rack links. This means that AEC cables are the infrastructure required for NVDA's 72-GPU Blackwell rack.

Third, Super Micro Computer  and Celestica  manufacture and sell GPU racks and systems using NVDA technology. Nvidia currently provides complete data centre racks containing tens of thousands of GPUs, which are delivered to system builders like SMCI and CLS. They then collaborate with NVDA to package and sell these racks to hyperscale customers such as Microsoft, Meta, and Amazon. For more information, please refer to this article from SMCI and this article from Celestica.

In summary, these partnerships demonstrate NVIDIA's connectivity within the AI ecosystem. This confirms that NVIDIA is indeed the queen of the AI chessboard.

For a company with a market capitalisation of 4.22 trillion dollars, it still has significant growth opportunities, particularly in the Chinese market, which means there is much to watch for with NVIDIA. Additionally, I note that NVIDIA has an A- growth rating, as shown in the figure below. The company's expected revenue growth rate is 60.71%, while the industry median is 7.28%. Furthermore, its 3-5 year compound annual growth rate  for expected long-term earnings per share  growth is 29.09%, compared to the industry median of 14.29%. This clearly indicates the expected growth levels for certain potential AI opportunities, such as the Omniverse platform and the Chinese AI market.

Now, when it comes to valuation, the growth outlook is becoming clearer. First, when I look at the chart below, I notice that most metrics are above the industry median, indicating that the valuation is higher than the industry median. Its non-GAAP forward price-to-earnings ratio is 40.12 times, and its forward enterprise value to EBITDA ratio is 34.79 times, both significantly higher than the industry median. However, when I look at the non-GAAP forward price-to-earnings ratio , it indicates that the valuation is undervalued by 27%. NVDA's price-to-earnings ratio is 1.38 times, while the industry median is 1.90 times. Based on the GAAP trailing 12-month PEG, the company's P/E ratio is 0.69 times, undervalued by 31% compared to the industry median.

Due to this milestone, NVDA's Jensen Huang estimates that NVDA's potential market size  in China will reach $50 billion. This means that China's spending on AI will increase, and Nvidia's growth prospects are expected to be stronger than ever before. I expect this growth outlook to be reflected in the upcoming quarterly earnings report to be released on 27 August 2025.

These factors combined will undoubtedly accelerate Nvidia's growth trajectory over the next 12 to 24 months. Therefore, I assign a ‚ÄòBuy‚Äô rating to Nvidia Corporation.

Nvidia's AI Ecosystem

Having highlighted the case for NVDA, I would like to connect it to some AI components I have researched previously. Some of these AI companies have remarkable growth prospects and are expected to align their growth trajectories with NVDA. Additionally, the connections between NVDA and these AI companies will help us better understand NVDA's future direction.

First, Astera Labs  is a leading connectivity chip company that recently went public in 2024. ALAB's chips support scalable and low-latency GPU rack interconnects. For more information on Astera Labs and its chips, please refer to Article 1 and Article 2. Now, Nvidia has publicly announced its collaboration with Astera on NVLink Fusion. This collaboration expands NVDA's total addressable market (TAM).

There is also Credo Technology, which is known for its active cables  re-timers, and SerDes chips. According to SA Oakoff Investments, most hyperscale computing vendors now consider CRDO's AEC to be the de facto standard for in-rack links. This means that AEC cables are the infrastructure required for NVDA's 72-GPU Blackwell rack.

Third, Super Micro Computer  and Celestica  manufacture and sell GPU racks and systems using NVDA technology. Nvidia currently provides complete data centre racks containing tens of thousands of GPUs, which are delivered to system builders like SMCI and CLS. They then collaborate with NVDA to package and sell these racks to hyperscale customers such as Microsoft, Meta, and Amazon. For more information, please refer to this article from SMCI and this article from Celestica.

In summary, these partnerships demonstrate NVIDIA's connectivity within the AI ecosystem. This confirms that NVIDIA is indeed the queen of the AI chessboard.

For a company with a market capitalisation of 4.22 trillion dollars, it still has significant growth opportunities, particularly in the Chinese market, which means there is much to watch for with NVIDIA. Additionally, I note that NVIDIA has an A- growth rating, as shown in the figure below. The company's expected revenue growth rate is 60.71%, while the industry median is 7.28%. Furthermore, its 3-5 year compound annual growth rate  for expected long-term earnings per share  growth is 29.09%, compared to the industry median of 14.29%. This clearly indicates the expected growth levels for certain potential AI opportunities, such as the Omniverse platform and the Chinese AI market.

Now, when it comes to valuation, the growth outlook is becoming clearer. First, when I look at the chart below, I notice that most metrics are above the industry median, indicating that the valuation is higher than the industry median. Its non-GAAP forward price-to-earnings ratio is 40.12 times, and its forward enterprise value to EBITDA ratio is 34.79 times, both significantly higher than the industry median. However, when I look at the non-GAAP forward price-to-earnings ratio , it indicates that the valuation is undervalued by 27%. NVDA's price-to-earnings ratio is 1.38 times, while the industry median is 1.90 times. Based on the GAAP trailing 12-month PEG, the company's P/E ratio is 0.69 times, undervalued by 31% compared to the industry median. Ideally, I would say that most multiples look high in absolute terms, but compared to NVDA's 60.71% compound annual growth rate, the stock's valuation isn't as high as it appears.

In terms of peer comparison, I chose NVDA's closest competitors because Nvidia is already far ahead in terms of market capitalisation, so I chose Broadcom and AMD. I noticed that NVDA's price-to-earnings ratio and expected price-to-earnings ratio are still lower than its peers.

I believe that the biggest risk facing NVIDIA at present is geopolitical risk. Currently, there are many uncertainties between China and the United States, especially following the imposition of tariffs on Liberation Day and the U.S. government's decision to suspend exports of H20 GPUs to China. Such situations could recur and undermine NVIDIA's growth plans and market expansion efforts. Losing the Chinese market would have a significant impact on NVIDIA's business. Additionally, geopolitical events such as trade tariffs and sanctions could affect global supply or cloud computing spending in some of the key regions where NVIDIA operates. In conclusion, in this grand AI infrastructure game, NVIDIA is the queen. Currently, it is the most powerful and flexible piece on the board. Compared to peers that may occupy other key positions, NVIDIA controls every direction. For example, AMD is the rook, SMCI is the bishop, while Credo and Astera are agile knights. Ultimately, NVIDIA determines the pace and scope of this game. As AI demand continues to grow, NVIDIA's dominant position is further strengthened by the expansion of the Chinese market. || Nvidia Will Continue Controlling The AI Board Nvidia is the 'queen' of the AI ecosystem, dominating hardware, software, and systems and controlling key segments from training to inference and networking.

Unmatched AI leadership, explosive revenue growth, and strategic partnerships with players like Astera Labs, Credo, and Super Micro Computer reinforce Nvidia's central role.

China market access and the Omniverse platform provide significant new growth drivers, supporting a strong 12-24 month growth outlook and a buy rating.

Despite high absolute valuation multiples, Nvidia's rapid growth and favorable PEG ratios make it attractive versus peers; the main risk is US-China geopolitical tension.

I believe these companies are well-positioned in the AI ecosystem, but I realise that one piece is missing: the queen. Just like in a game of chess, the queen is the most powerful and versatile piece on the board. It can move in any direction (horizontal, vertical, and diagonal) and quickly cover a wide area. That is why I believe it is a perfect fit for NVIDIA (NVDA). I say this because it dominates both offensively and defensively. Just as the queen controls most of the board, NVDA controls the most valuable parts of the AI infrastructure, from training to inference, simulation, and networking. Secondly, it is versatile and critical because it spans hardware, software, and systems. This is cool because few participants can match its breadth and influence. Finally, it leverages strategic partnerships. I mean, just as the queen commands pawns, rooks, and bishops, NVDA integrates system builders (such as Super Micro Computer (SMCI)), connectivity providers (such as Credo Technology Group (CRDO) and Astera Labs (ALAB)), and government AI programmes to expand its control over the AI battlefield.

So why is the queen so special?

Well, several factors set Nvidia apart. First and foremost, it holds an unparalleled leadership position in the AI field, thanks to the combination of hardware, software, and ecosystem advantages. Its Blackwell GPU architecture makes it uniquely special. Combined with the Omniverse simulation platform, we are driving self-reinforcing AI, which is driving explosive growth. For example, in the first quarter of the 2026 fiscal year, NVDA achieved revenue of $44.1 billion, representing a year over year increase of 69%. Data centre revenue reached $39.1 billion, up 73%. Some of Nvidia's key customers such as Microsoft , Google  OpenAI, and Meta  deploy tens of thousands of Nvidia's latest GPUs each quarter. For example, according to SA Weebler Finance data, hyperscale data centre operators are running approximately 1,000 NVLink rack systems (about 72,000 GPUs) per week, with further increases expected. Ideally, this means Nvidia's data centre run rate in the AI computing sector has exceeded $170 billion annually.

Secondly, NVDA's stack is also expanding beyond GPUs. As I mentioned, its global industrial simulation platform is now being used to digitise entire factories and cities. In fact, the platform has evolved to support critical infrastructure. Original equipment manufacturers like BMW are running over 30 virtual factories on the platform to optimise production in advance. As each AI solution requires an increasing amount of synthetic training data, NVDA's end-to-end solutions form an unparalleled moat. Ideally, this platform means more users generating more simulation data, ultimately driving demand for more Nvidia computing resources. What I see is that NVDA is now at the centre of the AI value chain.

Finally, the U.S. has approved the resumption of exports of NVIDIA H20 AI GPUs to China. This means NVIDIA will be able to access China's potential market, which is significant. According to a Morgan Stanley report, China's AI market is expected to reach $1.4 trillion by 2030.

China has been systematically implementing a long-term strategy to build its domestic artificial intelligence capabilities. Its strong academic foundation, innovative methods, data, talent, and growing foreign investment are driving it toward becoming a leading artificial intelligence powerhouse...

‚Äò...China is less concerned with building the most powerful AI capabilities and more focused on bringing AI to market. China embraces open-source AI, while the United States appears to be moving toward closed, tightly controlled AI systems...‚Äô

NVDA,2025-07-21,US,"AI Action Day This Wednesday I posted a couple days ago expressing my view that money can be made by being on top of trump's agenda, policy-related news, etc. I'm not saying its easy, but I think in several instances so far this year, the ""puzzle pieces"" have been out there, and if you put them together, you could have positioned ahead of the news. MP was one i mentioned in my previous post but there have been others.

To get to the point... There is an ""AI Action Day"" event happening on Wednesday. Hosted by All-In podcast people (David Sachs) and with various tech leaders in attendance as well as Trump of course.  Supposedly this will be an announcement of a larger strategy to promote US AI dominance. I would bet that there are opportunities here. Not clear if there is a home run, but I think a smart person could figure out a smart way to play this.

Unfortunately, I'm not a smart person, but maybe collectively as a group of not-smart people, we can figure out some plays here.

I can't link sources for some reason, keeps deleting my post, but you guys can google more information regarding the event if you want. TLDR It's being hosted

Technology leaders participating in the event include **Chris Power, CEO of Hadrian**; **Shyam Sankar, CTO of Palantir**; **Paul Buchheit, Partner at YCombinator; James Litinsky, CEO of MP Materials; Lisa Su, CEO of AMD.**

Additional speakers are still being confirmed.

I don't think the obvious choices are going to move much here. NVDA is already up significantly and i don't expect any announcements big enough to move a 4 trillion market cap... The easing of chip restrictions is also already priced in now. I expected this will be touched on at the event, but it's no longer news.

Spitballing but a few ideas:

I think energy will be a major focus of any strategy announcement. This is an area that is critically important for AI, and an area where the US is SIGNIFICANTLY lagging China. I'm not too sure how this could be played, but I'm considering EQT. I was looking at them last week due to the PA AI event. The stock didn't move much unfortunately, but all of nat gas seems to have struggled to close the week for whatever reason. By no means an expert here, but EQT has a major grift angle in that their CEO is closely tied to the republican party/trump.

Datacenter buildout: PWR, ACM, FLR - not really sure here. Chatgpt helped me on this one. Maybe APLD? Could be some type of policy/tax incentive to stimulate datacenter construction. not that its really needed at this point...

I'm really just spitballing and hoping to start some conversation here. || Selling almost everything but bonds. What I'm keeping. Sold today, CCJ

CEOs are always right, right? Remember when Zuck renamed his entire company after the metaverse? That same guy said AI would replace all developers by mid-2025. Well, here we are in mid-2025, and not only has Meta paid the most money ever for a developer, but guess what? They have 2,000 job openings for engineers!
3. **All these keynotes promoting AI seem specifically tailored for investors they don't care about anyone else.** It's like they're screaming, ""BUY OUR STOCK, IT WILL GO TO THE MOON,"" but they can't legally say it. Jensen Huang has been openly mocking Masayoshi Son about selling NVDA stock at every public appearance, almost like he'll do the same to you if you sell!
4. **So far, companies have invested massively and saved very little money.** Microsoft, for example, recently claimed they saved $500 million because of AI, but they also invested $50 billion. The media went into a frenzy reporting on how much money they saved, as if $500 million is a great return on $50 billion.
5. **In Silicon Valley, the craziness has reached unimaginable heights.** Everyone and their dog has an AI startup getting $50 million in seed money, promising ""agentic AI models"" that will analyze your cat's poop and order Amazon food based on its constipation levels. On LinkedIn alone, there are 20,000 job openings in San Francisco for AI engineers, while there are only about 1,000 actual AI engineers available. Companies like Meta are paying $200 million for top engineers.
6. **There's almost no competitive advantage anymore, as open-source models are nearly as good as private ones.** All the big companies are monopolies in their fields. How can you maintain a monopoly when your product is free, open source, and runs on a Mac Studio?
7. **All major AI companies have predicted AGI (Artificial General Intelligence) would be here by now.** Yet, AGI is always ""one year away.""
8. **When everyone thinks something will happen, it always goes the other direction.**
9. **Big, revolutionary changes have never happened in a year or two.** The internet, for example, took 20 years to achieve mass adoption. || Need to diversify from NVDA after 5,508% gain Around 10 years ago (I don‚Äôt remember which year exactly) I was sitting in the cafeteria at work, and the table next to me was talking about what a great stock NVDA was.

 || Muted Results but Booming Guidance: NVDA Q2 Earnings Analysis **TL;DR at the bottom--I broke my wrist touching grass last weekend so this** ***is*** **the short version**

This is my third consecutive quarter posting an independent analysis of NVDA‚Äôs quarterly earnings. My Q4 FY25 and Q1 FY26 estimates are available on my profile, and a comparison to analyst consensus and actual results in those quarters can be seen below.

[Note 2025Q1 Refers to Non-GAAP H20 Excluded](https://preview.redd.it/mmfycac78bef1.png?width=600&format=png&auto=webp&s=4f6bdebbe39904b4b4e944ef04c1020325685bdf)

On last quarter's earnings call, the Company guided for a considerable slowdown in revenue growth. They noted that the forecast included a negative impact of $8 billion from losing access to China. Jensen was particularly open on the call, saying,

‚ÄúOn export control... the platform that wins China is positioned to lead globally. Today, however, the $50 billion China market is effectively closed to U.S. industry.‚Äù

Jensen has been consistently meeting with Trump and his administration to get back into China. As recently as July 14th, NVDA provided a positive update on this disruption in a blog post, telling investors they are going to regain the ability to do so soon. Unfortunately, this will likely not affect revenue in Q2, but could lead to optimism from The Company when issuing guidance for Q3 and beyond.

Like in Q1, I will analyze each of the four main revenue segments and create a combined estimate. Since the Data Center segment is both the largest and in the spotlight, I will start there. 

# Data Center Estimate:

When issuing guidance, Colette Kress (CFO) stated the following: ‚ÄúTotal revenue is expected to be $45 billion, plus or minus 2%. We expect modest sequential growth across all of our platforms. In Data Center, we anticipate the continued ramp of Blackwell to be partially offset by a decline in China revenue.‚Äù  
  
The Blackwell ramp is expected to be completely recognized this quarter, yet the segment is set to only experience ‚Äúmodest growth‚Äù due to being locked out of China. The H20 sales halt hit with about three weeks left in Q1, and revenue grew 9.83% QoQ. NVDA still does not have the license required to sell in China, with less than two weeks left in Q2. A re-acceleration of growth seems unlikely this quarter, and my initial estimate is closer to 5-7% growth (\~$41 to $42 billion).¬†

[The Graph Shows Revenue from Data Centers Since 2024Q1 and Highlights the Deceleration in 2025Q1.](https://preview.redd.it/7n0g32oz8bef1.png?width=600&format=png&auto=webp&s=d31bb77ea496875aa86919a961199b793d099415)

The negative impact from the disruption in China will be the largest in Q2, which suggests a continued slowdown in QoQ growth. $41.5 billion would represent just over 6% growth, and with the current data and outlook, it will serve as the preliminary estimate.

# Gaming Estimate:

The rebound in gaming revenue in Q1 outpaced even the most bullish estimates. The record $3.8 billion in Q1 revenue represented a \~50% QoQ increase and was over 15% higher than the previous record. The report cites strength from the partnership with Nintendo (Switch 2) and the CFO noted, ‚ÄúStrong adoption by gamers, creatives, and AI enthusiasts.‚Äù The gaming beat helped NVDA‚Äôs headline revenue total in Q1, and The Company is optimistic strength will continue. However, given the cyclical nature of gaming and Q1 being such a positive surprise, it is difficult to project further QoQ growth to another record. $3.5 billion in Q2 would achieve 20% YoY growth in this segment and will serve as the preliminary estimate.

[Visualization of Strong Rebound in Gaming Revenue in 2025Q1](https://preview.redd.it/a001knqd9bef1.png?width=600&format=png&auto=webp&s=73ce824ea06d28dd1f08ba742e551b97b7cd20ec)

# Prof. Visualization / Robotics & Auto Estimate:

In the interest of time, and given that these two segments combined for barely over $1 billion in Q1, these two segments are being bundled into one breakdown. Prof. Visualization was mentioned by the CFO on the conference call and is expected to return to QoQ growth after being flat in Q1. Robotics & Auto was down sequentially in Q1 but still up over 70% YoY. There was no mention of expectations in Q2. I currently have \~$1.15 billion for the two segments combined, and will look to fine-tune this closer to the release date.

# Total Revenue Estimate: $46.15 Billion



# Earnings Estimate:

On the Q1 report, NVDA added a Non-GAAP EPS line that specifically excluded the H20 charge. It came in at $0.96 per share, surpassing the consensus of $0.93 but falling $0.01 short of my $0.97 estimate. 

There was some initial confusion surrounding the three metrics as ‚Äúregular‚Äù Non-GAAP EPS came in at $0.81, much higher than the Factset analyst consensus of $0.73. 

In Q2, NVDA will likely return to reporting the standard two EPS metrics, and yahoo finance lists the average estimate from 40 analysts at $1.00 per share. The earnings whisper number is a bit lower at $0.94, while the highest estimate from a single analyst is $1.09. 

While it is relatively easy to find consensus estimates for headline figures like EPS and Total Revenue, most analysts do not break out revenue by segment nor show how they convert top-line revenue to bottom-line profitability. This analysis shows the full process of forecasting revenue by segment and how it translates to the bottom-line in a form of unique transparency. 

The last section established the revenue estimate, but to get to EPS, estimates need to be made for gross margin, operating expenses, non-operating expenses, and total shares outstanding. 

NVDA‚Äôs company-issued guidance for both gross margin and operating expenses has been largely reliable in recent quarters. In Q2, the company expects gross margin of 72% and operating costs of $4 billion, which are used in this estimate. 

The company does not issue guidance for non-operating expenses nor shares outstanding, but accurate estimates can be obtained. 

[Stabilization of Cost Increases in 2024 with uptick in 2025Q1](https://preview.redd.it/ulf2s2nz9bef1.png?width=600&format=png&auto=webp&s=38ed7a3d33b88cfaf4134645ffd638b043f67ca7)

The above graph shows historical data for non-operating expenses and QoQ growth for the segment. The growth rate has largely stabilized compared to previous years, even with an uptick in Q1. $4.0 billion would represent a decrease back to about 5% growth, while my current estimate of $4.1 billion represents an increase of just under 8%.¬†

Estimating shares outstanding can be tricky, as the company‚Äôs share repurchase program is inconsistent. NVDA still has about $25 billion authorized under the current plan for share repurchases, but that is down after aggressive buybacks in Q1.¬†

This analysis estimates about $9 billion in buybacks in Q2, reducing the shares outstanding from 24.61 to 24.55 billion (60m shares @ 150 = $9 B). The estimate is similar to the amount repurchased in Q4 and is lower than repurchases in Q1.¬†  


[EPS Calculation Visualized, While Highlighting Opaqueness of Consensus](https://preview.redd.it/kglfaixaabef1.png?width=1924&format=png&auto=webp&s=8d95f34e8f6bf00b14d87a7d6d645d9e400bb658)

The calculation comes out to $1.02 EPS, which is slightly above the average analyst‚Äôs expectations. $46.15 billion in revenue is also only slightly above the consensus.¬†

This is the closest my estimates have been to the consensus, which has been surpassed each of the last 10 quarters. Given that I expect relatively muted results this quarter, guidance for the rest of the year will be in focus during the call.¬†

# Guidance:

After the positive update on China sales, investors are looking for strong guidance. While it‚Äôs not as straightforward as adding the lost $8 billion back into the forecast, analysts are expecting the worst to be in the past. Investors are looking for signs that the ‚Äústart of the new wave‚Äù Jensen mentioned last quarter will materialize this year.¬†

The current expectation for Q3 revenue is \~$51.5 billion, an increase of 13% from Q2 expectations ($45.55). In Q1, revenue grew 10% QoQ to $44.06 billion. This means analysts expect just over 3% growth in the current quarter with notable re-acceleration in Q3.¬†

Analysts are looking for at least a piece of the Chinese market in Q3 with the $51.5 billion forecast. Q2 guidance would have been closer to $53 billion with full access to China, suggesting the Q3 forecast still projects some disruption in China near term.¬†

If NVDA signals a faster-than-expected ramp in sales to China, guidance expectations that already look strong could still be too low. However, any delays in the licensing process or misaligned inventory could dampen Q3‚Äôs forecast.¬†

# Valuation:

Regardless of belief in the company, NVDA is expensive right now. ‚ÄúExpensive‚Äù in this case means that it is trading at higher multiples than multi-year averages.¬†

Even using the H20 excluded EPS number from Q1, NVDA has earned $3.34 per share over the last four quarters. Trailing earnings are expected to increase to $3.66 after Q2‚Äôs report, while full year EPS is currently expected to come in at around $4.30.¬†

Based on a current price of \~$173, NVDA is currently trading at over 51x TTM earnings, and 40x forward earnings.

While NVDA has previously traded for 40x forward earnings, it has also traded for closer to 20x forward earnings as recently as this year.¬†

NVDA is also currently experiencing an elevated Price to Sales ratio (higher than 75% of history) of over 28x sales, and its Price to Book ratio of 50x is more expensive than 91% of NVDA‚Äôs history.¬†

Buying NVDA at $170 makes sense only if the company continues to deliver bullish surprises on top of already sky-high expectations. I am not selling shares ahead of the report, even with the price outpacing my targets.¬†

# Positions:

When I began posting NVDA analysis and creating my price targets, NVDA traded for about $140 per share. At the time, I felt the price was fair, and it wasn‚Äôt until the liberation day tariff sell-off to sub $90 that I began buying more aggressively.¬†

I currently own 200 shares with a cost basis around $125. While I expected NVDA to recover rather quickly, the near 100% rally from April lows leads me to believe hype and FOMO are driving the price higher rather than fundamental growth. While NVDA‚Äôs growth has been explosive, the current price leaves no room for negative catalysts.¬†

Based on my expectations for NVDA in the rest of 2025, I sold an ATM covered call expiring in December. I am willing to sell at $175 between now and the end of the year, so I decided to collect $3000 ($1500 x2) selling that call option. I now have $15 of downside protection through December or will sell my shares for a massive profit.¬†

When issuing guidance, Colette Kress (CFO) stated the following: ‚ÄúTotal revenue is expected to be $45 billion, plus or minus 2%. We expect modest sequential growth across all of our platforms. In Data Center, we anticipate the continued ramp of Blackwell to be partially offset by a decline in China revenue.‚Äù  
  
The Blackwell ramp is expected to be completely recognized this quarter, yet the segment is set to only experience ‚Äúmodest growth‚Äù due to being locked out of China. The H20 sales halt hit with about three weeks left in Q1, and revenue grew 9.83% QoQ. NVDA still does not have the license required to sell in China, with less than two weeks left in Q2. A re-acceleration of growth seems unlikely this quarter, and my initial estimate is closer to 5-7% growth (\~$41 to $42 billion).¬†

[The Graph Shows Revenue from Data Centers Since 2024Q1 and Highlights the Deceleration in 2025Q1.](https://preview.redd.it/7n0g32oz8bef1.png?width=600&format=png&auto=webp&s=d31bb77ea496875aa86919a961199b793d099415)

The negative impact from the disruption in China will be the largest in Q2, which suggests a continued slowdown in QoQ growth. $41.5 billion would represent just over 6% growth, and with the current data and outlook, it will serve as the preliminary estimate.

# Gaming Estimate:

The rebound in gaming revenue in Q1 outpaced even the most bullish estimates. The record $3.8 billion in Q1 revenue represented a \~50% QoQ increase and was over 15% higher than the previous record. The report cites strength from the partnership with Nintendo (Switch 2) and the CFO noted, ‚ÄúStrong adoption by gamers, creatives, and AI enthusiasts.‚Äù The gaming beat helped NVDA‚Äôs headline revenue total in Q1, and The Company is optimistic strength will continue. However, given the cyclical nature of gaming and Q1 being such a positive surprise, it is difficult to project further QoQ growth to another record. $3.5 billion in Q2 would achieve 20% YoY growth in this segment and will serve as the preliminary estimate.

# Prof. Visualization / Robotics & Auto Estimate:

In the interest of time, and given that these two segments combined for barely over $1 billion in Q1, these two segments are being bundled into one breakdown. Prof. Visualization was mentioned by the CFO on the conference call and is expected to return to QoQ growth after being flat in Q1. Robotics & Auto was down sequentially in Q1 but still up over 70% YoY. There was no mention of expectations in Q2. I currently have \~$1.15 billion for the two segments combined, and will look to fine-tune this closer to the release date.

# Total Revenue Estimate: $46.15 Billion



# Earnings Estimate:

On the Q1 report, NVDA added a Non-GAAP EPS line that specifically excluded the H20 charge. It came in at $0.96 per share, surpassing the consensus of $0.93 but falling $0.01 short of my $0.97 estimate. 

There was some initial confusion surrounding the three metrics as ‚Äúregular‚Äù Non-GAAP EPS came in at $0.81, much higher than the Factset analyst consensus of $0.73. 

In Q2, NVDA will likely return to reporting the standard two EPS metrics, and yahoo finance lists the average estimate from 40 analysts at $1.00 per share. The earnings whisper number is a bit lower at $0.94, while the highest estimate from a single analyst is $1.09. 

While it is relatively easy to find consensus estimates for headline figures like EPS and Total Revenue, most analysts do not break out revenue by segment nor show how they convert top-line revenue to bottom-line profitability. This analysis shows the full process of forecasting revenue by segment and how it translates to the bottom-line in a form of unique transparency. 

The last section established the revenue estimate, but to get to EPS, estimates need to be made for gross margin, operating expenses, non-operating expenses, and total shares outstanding. 

NVDA‚Äôs company-issued guidance for both gross margin and operating expenses has been largely reliable in recent quarters. In Q2, the company expects gross margin of 72% and operating costs of $4 billion, which are used in this estimate. 

The company does not issue guidance for non-operating expenses nor shares outstanding, but accurate estimates can be obtained. 

[Stabilization of Cost Increases in 2024 with uptick in 2025Q1](https://preview.redd.it/ulf2s2nz9bef1.png?width=600&format=png&auto=webp&s=38ed7a3d33b88cfaf4134645ffd638b043f67ca7)

The above graph shows historical data for non-operating expenses and QoQ growth for the segment. The growth rate has largely stabilized compared to previous years, even with an uptick in Q1. $4.0 billion would represent a decrease back to about 5% growth, while my current estimate of $4.1 billion represents an increase of just under 8%.¬†

Estimating shares outstanding can be tricky, as the company‚Äôs share repurchase program is inconsistent. NVDA still has about $25 billion authorized under the current plan for share repurchases, but that is down after aggressive buybacks in Q1.¬†

This analysis estimates about $9 billion in buybacks in Q2, reducing the shares outstanding from 24.61 to 24.55 billion (60m shares @ 150 = $9 B). The estimate is similar to the amount repurchased in Q4 and is lower than repurchases in Q1.¬†  


[EPS Calculation Visualized, While Highlighting Opaqueness of Consensus](https://preview.redd.it/kglfaixaabef1.png?width=1924&format=png&auto=webp&s=8d95f34e8f6bf00b14d87a7d6d645d9e400bb658)

The calculation comes out to $1.02 EPS, which is slightly above the average analyst‚Äôs expectations. $46.15 billion in revenue is also only slightly above the consensus.¬†

This is the closest my estimates have been to the consensus, which has been surpassed each of the last 10 quarters. Given that I expect relatively muted results this quarter, guidance for the rest of the year will be in focus during the call.¬†

# Guidance:

After the positive update on China sales, investors are looking for strong guidance. While it‚Äôs not as straightforward as adding the lost $8 billion back into the forecast, analysts are expecting the worst to be in the past. Investors are looking for signs that the ‚Äústart of the new wave‚Äù Jensen mentioned last quarter will materialize this year.¬†

The current expectation for Q3 revenue is \~$51.5 billion, an increase of 13% from Q2 expectations ($45.55). In Q1, revenue grew 10% QoQ to $44.06 billion. This means analysts expect just over 3% growth in the current quarter with notable re-acceleration in Q3.¬†

Analysts are looking for at least a piece of the Chinese market in Q3 with the $51.5 billion forecast. Q2 guidance would have been closer to $53 billion with full access to China, suggesting the Q3 forecast still projects some disruption in China near term.¬†

If NVDA signals a faster-than-expected ramp in sales to China, guidance expectations that already look strong could still be too low. However, any delays in the licensing process or misaligned inventory could dampen Q3‚Äôs forecast.¬†

# Valuation:

Regardless of belief in the company, NVDA is expensive right now. ‚ÄúExpensive‚Äù in this case means that it is trading at higher multiples than multi-year averages.¬†

Even using the H20 excluded EPS number from Q1, NVDA has earned $3.34 per share over the last four quarters. Trailing earnings are expected to increase to $3.66 after Q2‚Äôs report, while full year EPS is currently expected to come in at around $4.30.¬†

Based on a current price of \~$173, NVDA is currently trading at over 51x TTM earnings, and 40x forward earnings.

While NVDA has previously traded for 40x forward earnings, it has also traded for closer to 20x forward earnings as recently as this year.¬†

NVDA is also currently experiencing an elevated Price to Sales ratio (higher than 75% of history) of over 28x sales, and its Price to Book ratio of 50x is more expensive than 91% of NVDA‚Äôs history.¬†

Buying NVDA at $170 makes sense only if the company continues to deliver bullish surprises on top of already sky-high expectations. I am not selling shares ahead of the report, even with the price outpacing my targets.¬†

# Positions:

When I began posting NVDA analysis and creating my price targets, NVDA traded for about $140 per share. At the time, I felt the price was fair, and it wasn‚Äôt until the liberation day tariff sell-off to sub $90 that I began buying more aggressively.¬†

I currently own 200 shares with a cost basis around $125. While I expected NVDA to recover rather quickly, the near 100% rally from April lows leads me to believe hype and FOMO are driving the price higher rather than fundamental growth. While NVDA‚Äôs growth has been explosive, the current price leaves no room for negative catalysts.¬†

Based on my expectations for NVDA in the rest of 2025, I sold an ATM covered call expiring in December. I am willing to sell at $175 between now and the end of the year, so I decided to collect $3000 ($1500 x2) selling that call option. I now have $15 of downside protection through December or will sell my shares for a massive profit.¬†

This is my third consecutive quarter posting an independent analysis of NVDA‚Äôs quarterly earnings. My Q4 FY25 and Q1 FY26 estimates are available on my profile, and a comparison to analyst consensus and actual results in those quarters can be seen below.

[Note 2025Q1 Refers to Non-GAAP H20 Excluded](https://preview.redd.it/mmfycac78bef1.png?width=600&format=png&auto=webp&s=4f6bdebbe39904b4b4e944ef04c1020325685bdf)

On last quarter's earnings call, the Company guided for a considerable slowdown in revenue growth. They noted that the forecast included a negative impact of $8 billion from losing access to China. Jensen was particularly open on the call, saying,

‚ÄúOn export control... the platform that wins China is positioned to lead globally. Today, however, the $50 billion China market is effectively closed to U.S. industry.‚Äù

Jensen has been consistently meeting with Trump and his administration to get back into China. As recently as July 14th, NVDA provided a positive update on this disruption in a blog post, telling investors they are going to regain the ability to do so soon. Unfortunately, this will likely not affect revenue in Q2, but could lead to optimism from The Company when issuing guidance for Q3 and beyond.

Like in Q1, I will analyze each of the four main revenue segments and create a combined estimate. Since the Data Center segment is both the largest and in the spotlight, I will start there.

However, given the cyclical nature of gaming and Q1 being such a positive surprise, it is difficult to project further QoQ growth to another record. $3.5 billion in Q2 would achieve 20% YoY growth in this segment and will serve as the preliminary estimate.

The calculation comes out to $1.02 EPS, which is slightly above the average analyst‚Äôs expectations. $46.15 billion in revenue is also only slightly above the consensus.¬†

This is the closest my estimates have been to the consensus, which has been surpassed each of the last 10 quarters. Given that I expect relatively muted results this quarter, guidance for the rest of the year will be in focus during the call.¬†

# Guidance:

After the positive update on China sales, investors are looking for strong guidance. While it‚Äôs not as straightforward as adding the lost $8 billion back into the forecast, analysts are expecting the worst to be in the past. Investors are looking for signs that the ‚Äústart of the new wave‚Äù Jensen mentioned last quarter will materialize this year.¬†

The current expectation for Q3 revenue is \~$51.5 billion, an increase of 13% from Q2 expectations ($45.55). In Q1, revenue grew 10% QoQ to $44.06 billion. This means analysts expect just over 3% growth in the current quarter with notable re-acceleration in Q3.¬†

Analysts are looking for at least a piece of the Chinese market in Q3 with the $51.5 billion forecast. Q2 guidance would have been closer to $53 billion with full access to China, suggesting the Q3 forecast still projects some disruption in China near term.¬†

If NVDA signals a faster-than-expected ramp in sales to China, guidance expectations that already look strong could still be too low. However, any delays in the licensing process or misaligned inventory could dampen Q3‚Äôs forecast.¬†

# Valuation:

Regardless of belief in the company, NVDA is expensive right now. ‚ÄúExpensive‚Äù in this case means that it is trading at higher multiples than multi-year averages.¬†

Even using the H20 excluded EPS number from Q1, NVDA has earned $3.34 per share over the last four quarters. Trailing earnings are expected to increase to $3.66 after Q2‚Äôs report, while full year EPS is currently expected to come in at around $4.30.¬†

Based on a current price of \~$173, NVDA is currently trading at over 51x TTM earnings, and 40x forward earnings.

While NVDA has previously traded for 40x forward earnings, it has also traded for closer to 20x forward earnings as recently as this year.¬†

NVDA is also currently experiencing an elevated Price to Sales ratio (higher than 75% of history) of over 28x sales, and its Price to Book ratio of 50x is more expensive than 91% of NVDA‚Äôs history.¬†

Buying NVDA at $170 makes sense only if the company continues to deliver bullish surprises on top of already sky-high expectations. I am not selling shares ahead of the report, even with the price outpacing my targets.¬†

# Positions:

When I began posting NVDA analysis and creating my price targets, NVDA traded for about $140 per share. At the time, I felt the price was fair, and it wasn‚Äôt until the liberation day tariff sell-off to sub $90 that I began buying more aggressively.¬†

I currently own 200 shares with a cost basis around $125. While I expected NVDA to recover rather quickly, the near 100% rally from April lows leads me to believe hype and FOMO are driving the price higher rather than fundamental growth. While NVDA‚Äôs growth has been explosive, the current price leaves no room for negative catalysts.¬†

Based on my expectations for NVDA in the rest of 2025, I sold an ATM covered call expiring in December. I am willing to sell at $175 between now and the end of the year, so I decided to collect $3000 ($1500 x2) selling that call option. I now have $15 of downside protection through December or will sell my shares for a massive profit.¬†

This is my third consecutive quarter posting an independent analysis of NVDA‚Äôs quarterly earnings. My Q4 FY25 and Q1 FY26 estimates are available on my profile, and a comparison to analyst consensus and actual results in those quarters can be seen below.

[Note 2025Q1 Refers to Non-GAAP H20 Excluded](https://preview.redd.it/mmfycac78bef1.png?width=600&format=png&auto=webp&s=4f6bdebbe39904b4b4e944ef04c1020325685bdf)

On last quarter's earnings call, the Company guided for a considerable slowdown in revenue growth. They noted that the forecast included a negative impact of $8 billion from losing access to China. Jensen was particularly open on the call, saying,

‚ÄúOn export control... the platform that wins China is positioned to lead globally. Today, however, the $50 billion China market is effectively closed to U.S. industry.‚Äù

Jensen has been consistently meeting with Trump and his administration to get back into China. As recently as July 14th, NVDA provided a positive update on this disruption in a blog post, telling investors they are going to regain the ability to do so soon. Unfortunately, this will likely not affect revenue in Q2, but could lead to optimism from The Company when issuing guidance for Q3 and beyond.

Like in Q1, I will analyze each of the four main revenue segments and create a combined estimate. Since the Data Center segment is both the largest and in the spotlight, I will start there. 

# Data Center Estimate:

When issuing guidance, Colette Kress (CFO) stated the following: ‚ÄúTotal revenue is expected to be $45 billion, plus or minus 2%. We expect modest sequential growth across all of our platforms. In Data Center, we anticipate the continued ramp of Blackwell to be partially offset by a decline in China revenue.‚Äù  
  
The Blackwell ramp is expected to be completely recognized this quarter, yet the segment is set to only experience ‚Äúmodest growth‚Äù due to being locked out of China. The H20 sales halt hit with about three weeks left in Q1, and revenue grew 9.83% QoQ. NVDA still does not have the license required to sell in China, with less than two weeks left in Q2. A re-acceleration of growth seems unlikely this quarter, and my initial estimate is closer to 5-7% growth (\~$41 to $42 billion).¬†

[The Graph Shows Revenue from Data Centers Since 2024Q1 and Highlights the Deceleration in 2025Q1.](https://preview.redd.it/7n0g32oz8bef1.png?width=600&format=png&auto=webp&s=d31bb77ea496875aa86919a961199b793d099415)

The negative impact from the disruption in China will be the largest in Q2, which suggests a continued slowdown in QoQ growth. $41.5 billion would represent just over 6% growth, and with the current data and outlook, it will serve as the preliminary estimate.

# Gaming Estimate:

The rebound in gaming revenue in Q1 outpaced even the most bullish estimates. The record $3.8 billion in Q1 revenue represented a \~50% QoQ increase and was over 15% higher than the previous record. The report cites strength from the partnership with Nintendo (Switch 2) and the CFO noted, ‚ÄúStrong adoption by gamers, creatives, and AI enthusiasts.‚Äù The gaming beat helped NVDA‚Äôs headline revenue total in Q1, and The Company is optimistic strength will continue. However, given the cyclical nature of gaming and Q1 being such a positive surprise, it is difficult to project further QoQ growth to another record. $3.5 billion in Q2 would achieve 20% YoY growth in this segment and will serve as the preliminary estimate.

[Visualization of Strong Rebound in Gaming Revenue in 2025Q1](https://preview.redd.it/a001knqd9bef1.png?width=600&format=png&auto=webp&s=73ce824ea06d28dd1f08ba742e551b97b7cd20ec)

# Prof. Visualization / Robotics & Auto Estimate:

In the interest of time, and given that these two segments combined for barely over $1 billion in Q1, these two segments are being bundled into one breakdown. Prof. Visualization was mentioned by the CFO on the conference call and is expected to return to QoQ growth after being flat in Q1. Robotics & Auto was down sequentially in Q1 but still up over 70% YoY. There was no mention of expectations in Q2. I currently have \~$1.15 billion for the two segments combined, and will look to fine-tune this closer to the release date.

# Total Revenue Estimate: $46.15 Billion



# Earnings Estimate:

On the Q1 report, NVDA added a Non-GAAP EPS line that specifically excluded the H20 charge. It came in at $0.96 per share, surpassing the consensus of $0.93 but falling $0.01 short of my $0.97 estimate. 

There was some initial confusion surrounding the three metrics as ‚Äúregular‚Äù Non-GAAP EPS came in at $0.81, much higher than the Factset analyst consensus of $0.73. 

In Q2, NVDA will likely return to reporting the standard two EPS metrics, and yahoo finance lists the average estimate from 40 analysts at $1.00 per share. The earnings whisper number is a bit lower at $0.94, while the highest estimate from a single analyst is $1.09. 

While it is relatively easy to find consensus estimates for headline figures like EPS and Total Revenue, most analysts do not break out revenue by segment nor show how they convert top-line revenue to bottom-line profitability. This analysis shows the full process of forecasting revenue by segment and how it translates to the bottom-line in a form of unique transparency. 

The last section established the revenue estimate, but to get to EPS, estimates need to be made for gross margin, operating expenses, non-operating expenses, and total shares outstanding. 

NVDA‚Äôs company-issued guidance for both gross margin and operating expenses has been largely reliable in recent quarters. In Q2, the company expects gross margin of 72% and operating costs of $4 billion, which are used in this estimate. 

The company does not issue guidance for non-operating expenses nor shares outstanding, but accurate estimates can be obtained. 

[Stabilization of Cost Increases in 2024 with uptick in 2025Q1](https://preview.redd.it/ulf2s2nz9bef1.png?width=600&format=png&auto=webp&s=38ed7a3d33b88cfaf4134645ffd638b043f67ca7)

The above graph shows historical data for non-operating expenses and QoQ growth for the segment. The growth rate has largely stabilized compared to previous years, even with an uptick in Q1. $4.0 billion would represent a decrease back to about 5% growth, while my current estimate of $4.1 billion represents an increase of just under 8%.¬†

Estimating shares outstanding can be tricky, as the company‚Äôs share repurchase program is inconsistent. NVDA still has about $25 billion authorized under the current plan for share repurchases, but that is down after aggressive buybacks in Q1.¬†

This analysis estimates about $9 billion in buybacks in Q2, reducing the shares outstanding from 24.61 to 24.55 billion (60m shares @ 150 = $9 B). The estimate is similar to the amount repurchased in Q4 and is lower than repurchases in Q1.¬†  


[EPS Calculation Visualized, While Highlighting Opaqueness of Consensus](https://preview.redd.it/kglfaixaabef1.png?width=1924&format=png&auto=webp&s=8d95f34e8f6bf00b14d87a7d6d645d9e400bb658)

The calculation comes out to $1.02 EPS, which is slightly above the average analyst‚Äôs expectations. $46.15 billion in revenue is also only slightly above the consensus.¬†

This is the closest my estimates have been to the consensus, which has been surpassed each of the last 10 quarters. Given that I expect relatively muted results this quarter, guidance for the rest of the year will be in focus during the call.¬†

On last quarter's earnings call, the Company guided for a considerable slowdown in revenue growth. They noted that the forecast included a negative impact of $8 billion from losing access to China. Jensen was particularly open on the call, saying,

‚ÄúOn export control... the platform that wins China is positioned to lead globally. Today, however, the $50 billion China market is effectively closed to U.S. industry.‚Äù

Jensen has been consistently meeting with Trump and his administration to get back into China. As recently as July 14th, NVDA provided a positive update on this disruption in a blog post, telling investors they are going to regain the ability to do so soon. Unfortunately, this will likely not affect revenue in Q2, but could lead to optimism from The Company when issuing guidance for Q3 and beyond.

Like in Q1, I will analyze each of the four main revenue segments and create a combined estimate. Since the Data Center segment is both the largest and in the spotlight, I will start there. 

# Data Center Estimate:

When issuing guidance, Colette Kress (CFO) stated the following: ‚ÄúTotal revenue is expected to be $45 billion, plus or minus 2%. We expect modest sequential growth across all of our platforms. In Data Center, we anticipate the continued ramp of Blackwell to be partially offset by a decline in China revenue.‚Äù  
  
The Blackwell ramp is expected to be completely recognized this quarter, yet the segment is set to only experience ‚Äúmodest growth‚Äù due to being locked out of China. The H20 sales halt hit with about three weeks left in Q1, and revenue grew 9.83% QoQ. NVDA still does not have the license required to sell in China, with less than two weeks left in Q2. A re-acceleration of growth seems unlikely this quarter, and my initial estimate is closer to 5-7% growth (\~$41 to $42 billion).¬†

[The Graph Shows Revenue from Data Centers Since 2024Q1 and Highlights the Deceleration in 2025Q1.](https://preview.redd.it/7n0g32oz8bef1.png?width=600&format=png&auto=webp&s=d31bb77ea496875aa86919a961199b793d099415)

The negative impact from the disruption in China will be the largest in Q2, which suggests a continued slowdown in QoQ growth. $41.5 billion would represent just over 6% growth, and with the current data and outlook, it will serve as the preliminary estimate.

# Gaming Estimate:

The rebound in gaming revenue in Q1 outpaced even the most bullish estimates. The record $3.8 billion in Q1 revenue represented a \~50% QoQ increase and was over 15% higher than the previous record. The report cites strength from the partnership with Nintendo (Switch 2) and the CFO noted, ‚ÄúStrong adoption by gamers, creatives, and AI enthusiasts.‚Äù The gaming beat helped NVDA‚Äôs headline revenue total in Q1, and The Company is optimistic strength will continue. However, given the cyclical nature of gaming and Q1 being such a positive surprise, it is difficult to project further QoQ growth to another record. $3.5 billion in Q2 would achieve 20% YoY growth in this segment and will serve as the preliminary estimate.

[Visualization of Strong Rebound in Gaming Revenue in 2025Q1](https://preview.redd.it/a001knqd9bef1.png?width=600&format=png&auto=webp&s=73ce824ea06d28dd1f08ba742e551b97b7cd20ec)

# Prof. Visualization / Robotics & Auto Estimate:

In the interest of time, and given that these two segments combined for barely over $1 billion in Q1, these two segments are being bundled into one breakdown. Prof. Visualization was mentioned by the CFO on the conference call and is expected to return to QoQ growth after being flat in Q1. Robotics & Auto was down sequentially in Q1 but still up over 70% YoY. There was no mention of expectations in Q2. I currently have \~$1.15 billion for the two segments combined, and will look to fine-tune this closer to the release date.

# Total Revenue Estimate: $46.15 Billion



# Earnings Estimate:

On the Q1 report, NVDA added a Non-GAAP EPS line that specifically excluded the H20 charge. It came in at $0.96 per share, surpassing the consensus of $0.93 but falling $0.01 short of my $0.97 estimate. 

There was some initial confusion surrounding the three metrics as ‚Äúregular‚Äù Non-GAAP EPS came in at $0.81, much higher than the Factset analyst consensus of $0.73. 

In Q2, NVDA will likely return to reporting the standard two EPS metrics, and yahoo finance lists the average estimate from 40 analysts at $1.00 per share. The earnings whisper number is a bit lower at $0.94, while the highest estimate from a single analyst is $1.09. 

While it is relatively easy to find consensus estimates for headline figures like EPS and Total Revenue, most analysts do not break out revenue by segment nor show how they convert top-line revenue to bottom-line profitability. This analysis shows the full process of forecasting revenue by segment and how it translates to the bottom-line in a form of unique transparency. 

The last section established the revenue estimate, but to get to EPS, estimates need to be made for gross margin, operating expenses, non-operating expenses, and total shares outstanding. 

NVDA‚Äôs company-issued guidance for both gross margin and operating expenses has been largely reliable in recent quarters. In Q2, the company expects gross margin of 72% and operating costs of $4 billion, which are used in this estimate. 

The company does not issue guidance for non-operating expenses nor shares outstanding, but accurate estimates can be obtained. 

[Stabilization of Cost Increases in 2024 with uptick in 2025Q1](https://preview.redd.it/ulf2s2nz9bef1.png?width=600&format=png&auto=webp&s=38ed7a3d33b88cfaf4134645ffd638b043f67ca7)

The above graph shows historical data for non-operating expenses and QoQ growth for the segment. The growth rate has largely stabilized compared to previous years, even with an uptick in Q1. $4.0 billion would represent a decrease back to about 5% growth, while my current estimate of $4.1 billion represents an increase of just under 8%.¬†

Estimating shares outstanding can be tricky, as the company‚Äôs share repurchase program is inconsistent. NVDA still has about $25 billion authorized under the current plan for share repurchases, but that is down after aggressive buybacks in Q1.¬†

This analysis estimates about $9 billion in buybacks in Q2, reducing the shares outstanding from 24.61 to 24.55 billion (60m shares @ 150 = $9 B). The estimate is similar to the amount repurchased in Q4 and is lower than repurchases in Q1.¬†  


[EPS Calculation Visualized, While Highlighting Opaqueness of Consensus](https://preview.redd.it/kglfaixaabef1.png?width=1924&format=png&auto=webp&s=8d95f34e8f6bf00b14d87a7d6d645d9e400bb658)

The calculation comes out to $1.02 EPS, which is slightly above the average analyst‚Äôs expectations. $46.15 billion in revenue is also only slightly above the consensus.¬†

This is the closest my estimates have been to the consensus, which has been surpassed each of the last 10 quarters. Given that I expect relatively muted results this quarter, guidance for the rest of the year will be in focus during the call.¬†

# Guidance:

After the positive update on China sales, investors are looking for strong guidance. While it‚Äôs not as straightforward as adding the lost $8 billion back into the forecast, analysts are expecting the worst to be in the past. Investors are looking for signs that the ‚Äústart of the new wave‚Äù Jensen mentioned last quarter will materialize this year.¬†

The current expectation for Q3 revenue is \~$51.5 billion, an increase of 13% from Q2 expectations ($45.55). In Q1, revenue grew 10% QoQ to $44.06 billion. This means analysts expect just over 3% growth in the current quarter with notable re-acceleration in Q3.¬†

Analysts are looking for at least a piece of the Chinese market in Q3 with the $51.5 billion forecast. Q2 guidance would have been closer to $53 billion with full access to China, suggesting the Q3 forecast still projects some disruption in China near term.¬†

If NVDA signals a faster-than-expected ramp in sales to China, guidance expectations that already look strong could still be too low. However, any delays in the licensing process or misaligned inventory could dampen Q3‚Äôs forecast.¬†

# Valuation:

Regardless of belief in the company, NVDA is expensive right now. ‚ÄúExpensive‚Äù in this case means that it is trading at higher multiples than multi-year averages.¬†

Even using the H20 excluded EPS number from Q1, NVDA has earned $3.34 per share over the last four quarters. Trailing earnings are expected to increase to $3.66 after Q2‚Äôs report, while full year EPS is currently expected to come in at around $4.30.¬†

Based on a current price of \~$173, NVDA is currently trading at over 51x TTM earnings, and 40x forward earnings.

While NVDA has previously traded for 40x forward earnings, it has also traded for closer to 20x forward earnings as recently as this year.¬†

NVDA is also currently experiencing an elevated Price to Sales ratio (higher than 75% of history) of over 28x sales, and its Price to Book ratio of 50x is more expensive than 91% of NVDA‚Äôs history.¬†

Buying NVDA at $170 makes sense only if the company continues to deliver bullish surprises on top of already sky-high expectations. I am not selling shares ahead of the report, even with the price outpacing my targets.¬†

# Positions:

When I began posting NVDA analysis and creating my price targets, NVDA traded for about $140 per share. At the time, I felt the price was fair, and it wasn‚Äôt until the liberation day tariff sell-off to sub $90 that I began buying more aggressively.¬†

I currently own 200 shares with a cost basis around $125. While I expected NVDA to recover rather quickly, the near 100% rally from April lows leads me to believe hype and FOMO are driving the price higher rather than fundamental growth. While NVDA‚Äôs growth has been explosive, the current price leaves no room for negative catalysts.¬†

Based on my expectations for NVDA in the rest of 2025, I sold an ATM covered call expiring in December. I am willing to sell at $175 between now and the end of the year, so I decided to collect $3000 ($1500 x2) selling that call option. I now have $15 of downside protection through December or will sell my shares for a massive profit.¬†

[Stabilization of Cost Increases in 2024 with uptick in 2025Q1](https://preview.redd.it/ulf2s2nz9bef1.png?width=600&format=png&auto=webp&s=38ed7a3d33b88cfaf4134645ffd638b043f67ca7)

The above graph shows historical data for non-operating expenses and QoQ growth for the segment. The growth rate has largely stabilized compared to previous years, even with an uptick in Q1. $4.0 billion would represent a decrease back to about 5% growth, while my current estimate of $4.1 billion represents an increase of just under 8%.¬†

Estimating shares outstanding can be tricky, as the company‚Äôs share repurchase program is inconsistent. NVDA still has about $25 billion authorized under the current plan for share repurchases, but that is down after aggressive buybacks in Q1.¬†

This analysis estimates about $9 billion in buybacks in Q2, reducing the shares outstanding from 24.61 to 24.55 billion (60m shares @ 150 = $9 B). The estimate is similar to the amount repurchased in Q4 and is lower than repurchases in Q1.¬†

The calculation comes out to $1.02 EPS, which is slightly above the average analyst‚Äôs expectations. $46.15 billion in revenue is also only slightly above the consensus.¬†

This is the closest my estimates have been to the consensus, which has been surpassed each of the last 10 quarters. Given that I expect relatively muted results this quarter, guidance for the rest of the year will be in focus during the call.¬†

# Guidance:

After the positive update on China sales, investors are looking for strong guidance. While it‚Äôs not as straightforward as adding the lost $8 billion back into the forecast, analysts are expecting the worst to be in the past. Investors are looking for signs that the ‚Äústart of the new wave‚Äù Jensen mentioned last quarter will materialize this year.¬†

The current expectation for Q3 revenue is \~$51.5 billion, an increase of 13% from Q2 expectations ($45.55). In Q1, revenue grew 10% QoQ to $44.06 billion. This means analysts expect just over 3% growth in the current quarter with notable re-acceleration in Q3.¬†

Analysts are looking for at least a piece of the Chinese market in Q3 with the $51.5 billion forecast. Q2 guidance would have been closer to $53 billion with full access to China, suggesting the Q3 forecast still projects some disruption in China near term.¬†

If NVDA signals a faster-than-expected ramp in sales to China, guidance expectations that already look strong could still be too low. However, any delays in the licensing process or misaligned inventory could dampen Q3‚Äôs forecast.¬†

# Valuation:

Regardless of belief in the company, NVDA is expensive right now. ‚ÄúExpensive‚Äù in this case means that it is trading at higher multiples than multi-year averages.¬†

Even using the H20 excluded EPS number from Q1, NVDA has earned $3.34 per share over the last four quarters. Trailing earnings are expected to increase to $3.66 after Q2‚Äôs report, while full year EPS is currently expected to come in at around $4.30.¬†

Based on a current price of \~$173, NVDA is currently trading at over 51x TTM earnings, and 40x forward earnings.

While NVDA has previously traded for 40x forward earnings, it has also traded for closer to 20x forward earnings as recently as this year.¬†

NVDA is also currently experiencing an elevated Price to Sales ratio (higher than 75% of history) of over 28x sales, and its Price to Book ratio of 50x is more expensive than 91% of NVDA‚Äôs history.¬†

Buying NVDA at $170 makes sense only if the company continues to deliver bullish surprises on top of already sky-high expectations. I am not selling shares ahead of the report, even with the price outpacing my targets.¬†

# Positions:

When I began posting NVDA analysis and creating my price targets, NVDA traded for about $140 per share. At the time, I felt the price was fair, and it wasn‚Äôt until the liberation day tariff sell-off to sub $90 that I began buying more aggressively.¬†

I currently own 200 shares with a cost basis around $125. While I expected NVDA to recover rather quickly, the near 100% rally from April lows leads me to believe hype and FOMO are driving the price higher rather than fundamental growth. While NVDA‚Äôs growth has been explosive, the current price leaves no room for negative catalysts.¬†

Based on my expectations for NVDA in the rest of 2025, I sold an ATM covered call expiring in December. I am willing to sell at $175 between now and the end of the year, so I decided to collect $3000 ($1500 x2) selling that call option. I now have $15 of downside protection through December or will sell my shares for a massive profit.¬†

This is my third consecutive quarter posting an independent analysis of NVDA‚Äôs quarterly earnings. My Q4 FY25 and Q1 FY26 estimates are available on my profile, and a comparison to analyst consensus and actual results in those quarters can be seen below.

[Note 2025Q1 Refers to Non-GAAP H20 Excluded](https://preview.redd.it/mmfycac78bef1.png?width=600&format=png&auto=webp&s=4f6bdebbe39904b4b4e944ef04c1020325685bdf)

[While Analysts Consistently Underestimate Revenue, My Bullish Bias has Decreased Significantly](https://preview.redd.it/zvdf6kug8bef1.png?width=848&format=png&auto=webp&s=bf6b37820b364715f26fbff6c646388c7c67959d)

On last quarter's earnings call, the Company guided for a considerable slowdown in revenue growth. They noted that the forecast included a negative impact of $8 billion from losing access to China. Jensen was particularly open on the call, saying,

‚ÄúOn export control... the platform that wins China is positioned to lead globally. Today, however, the $50 billion China market is effectively closed to U.S. industry.‚Äù

Jensen has been consistently meeting with Trump and his administration to get back into China. As recently as July 14th, NVDA provided a positive update on this disruption in a blog post, telling investors they are going to regain the ability to do so soon. Unfortunately, this will likely not affect revenue in Q2, but could lead to optimism from The Company when issuing guidance for Q3 and beyond.

Like in Q1, I will analyze each of the four main revenue segments and create a combined estimate. Since the Data Center segment is both the largest and in the spotlight, I will start there. 

# Data Center Estimate:

When issuing guidance, Colette Kress (CFO) stated the following: ‚ÄúTotal revenue is expected to be $45 billion, plus or minus 2%. We expect modest sequential growth across all of our platforms. In Data Center, we anticipate the continued ramp of Blackwell to be partially offset by a decline in China revenue.‚Äù  
  
The Blackwell ramp is expected to be completely recognized this quarter, yet the segment is set to only experience ‚Äúmodest growth‚Äù due to being locked out of China. The H20 sales halt hit with about three weeks left in Q1, and revenue grew 9.83% QoQ. NVDA still does not have the license required to sell in China, with less than two weeks left in Q2. A re-acceleration of growth seems unlikely this quarter, and my initial estimate is closer to 5-7% growth (\~$41 to $42 billion).¬†

[The Graph Shows Revenue from Data Centers Since 2024Q1 and Highlights the Deceleration in 2025Q1.](https://preview.redd.it/7n0g32oz8bef1.png?width=600&format=png&auto=webp&s=d31bb77ea496875aa86919a961199b793d099415)

The negative impact from the disruption in China will be the largest in Q2, which suggests a continued slowdown in QoQ growth. $41.5 billion would represent just over 6% growth, and with the current data and outlook, it will serve as the preliminary estimate.

# Gaming Estimate:

The rebound in gaming revenue in Q1 outpaced even the most bullish estimates. The record $3.8 billion in Q1 revenue represented a \~50% QoQ increase and was over 15% higher than the previous record. The report cites strength from the partnership with Nintendo (Switch 2) and the CFO noted, ‚ÄúStrong adoption by gamers, creatives, and AI enthusiasts.‚Äù The gaming beat helped NVDA‚Äôs headline revenue total in Q1, and The Company is optimistic strength will continue. However, given the cyclical nature of gaming and Q1 being such a positive surprise, it is difficult to project further QoQ growth to another record. $3.5 billion in Q2 would achieve 20% YoY growth in this segment and will serve as the preliminary estimate.

[Visualization of Strong Rebound in Gaming Revenue in 2025Q1](https://preview.redd.it/a001knqd9bef1.png?width=600&format=png&auto=webp&s=73ce824ea06d28dd1f08ba742e551b97b7cd20ec)

# Prof. Visualization / Robotics & Auto Estimate:

In the interest of time, and given that these two segments combined for barely over $1 billion in Q1, these two segments are being bundled into one breakdown. Prof. Visualization was mentioned by the CFO on the conference call and is expected to return to QoQ growth after being flat in Q1. Robotics & Auto was down sequentially in Q1 but still up over 70% YoY. There was no mention of expectations in Q2. I currently have \~$1.15 billion for the two segments combined, and will look to fine-tune this closer to the release date.

# Total Revenue Estimate: $46.15 Billion



# Earnings Estimate:

On the Q1 report, NVDA added a Non-GAAP EPS line that specifically excluded the H20 charge. It came in at $0.96 per share, surpassing the consensus of $0.93 but falling $0.01 short of my $0.97 estimate. 

There was some initial confusion surrounding the three metrics as ‚Äúregular‚Äù Non-GAAP EPS came in at $0.81, much higher than the Factset analyst consensus of $0.73. 

In Q2, NVDA will likely return to reporting the standard two EPS metrics, and yahoo finance lists the average estimate from 40 analysts at $1.00 per share. The earnings whisper number is a bit lower at $0.94, while the highest estimate from a single analyst is $1.09. 

While it is relatively easy to find consensus estimates for headline figures like EPS and Total Revenue, most analysts do not break out revenue by segment nor show how they convert top-line revenue to bottom-line profitability. This analysis shows the full process of forecasting revenue by segment and how it translates to the bottom-line in a form of unique transparency. 

The last section established the revenue estimate, but to get to EPS, estimates need to be made for gross margin, operating expenses, non-operating expenses, and total shares outstanding. 

NVDA‚Äôs company-issued guidance for both gross margin and operating expenses has been largely reliable in recent quarters. In Q2, the company expects gross margin of 72% and operating costs of $4 billion, which are used in this estimate. 

The company does not issue guidance for non-operating expenses nor shares outstanding, but accurate estimates can be obtained.

The above graph shows historical data for non-operating expenses and QoQ growth for the segment. The growth rate has largely stabilized compared to previous years, even with an uptick in Q1. $4.0 billion would represent a decrease back to about 5% growth, while my current estimate of $4.1 billion represents an increase of just under 8%.¬†

The calculation comes out to $1.02 EPS, which is slightly above the average analyst‚Äôs expectations. $46.15 billion in revenue is also only slightly above the consensus.¬†

This is the closest my estimates have been to the consensus, which has been surpassed each of the last 10 quarters. Given that I expect relatively muted results this quarter, guidance for the rest of the year will be in focus during the call.¬†

This is my third consecutive quarter posting an independent analysis of NVDA‚Äôs quarterly earnings. My Q4 FY25 and Q1 FY26 estimates are available on my profile, and a comparison to analyst consensus and actual results in those quarters can be seen below.

[Note 2025Q1 Refers to Non-GAAP H20 Excluded](https://preview.redd.it/mmfycac78bef1.png?width=600&format=png&auto=webp&s=4f6bdebbe39904b4b4e944ef04c1020325685bdf)

[While Analysts Consistently Underestimate Revenue, My Bullish Bias has Decreased Significantly](https://preview.redd.it/zvdf6kug8bef1.png?width=848&format=png&auto=webp&s=bf6b37820b364715f26fbff6c646388c7c67959d)

On last quarter's earnings call, the Company guided for a considerable slowdown in revenue growth. They noted that the forecast included a negative impact of $8 billion from losing access to China. Jensen was particularly open on the call, saying,

‚ÄúOn export control... the platform that wins China is positioned to lead globally. Today, however, the $50 billion China market is effectively closed to U.S. industry.‚Äù

Jensen has been consistently meeting with Trump and his administration to get back into China. As recently as July 14th, NVDA provided a positive update on this disruption in a blog post, telling investors they are going to regain the ability to do so soon. Unfortunately, this will likely not affect revenue in Q2, but could lead to optimism from The Company when issuing guidance for Q3 and beyond.

Like in Q1, I will analyze each of the four main revenue segments and create a combined estimate. Since the Data Center segment is both the largest and in the spotlight, I will start there. 

# Data Center Estimate:

When issuing guidance, Colette Kress (CFO) stated the following: ‚ÄúTotal revenue is expected to be $45 billion, plus or minus 2%. We expect modest sequential growth across all of our platforms. In Data Center, we anticipate the continued ramp of Blackwell to be partially offset by a decline in China revenue.‚Äù  
  
The Blackwell ramp is expected to be completely recognized this quarter, yet the segment is set to only experience ‚Äúmodest growth‚Äù due to being locked out of China. The H20 sales halt hit with about three weeks left in Q1, and revenue grew 9.83% QoQ. NVDA still does not have the license required to sell in China, with less than two weeks left in Q2. A re-acceleration of growth seems unlikely this quarter, and my initial estimate is closer to 5-7% growth (\~$41 to $42 billion).¬†

[The Graph Shows Revenue from Data Centers Since 2024Q1 and Highlights the Deceleration in 2025Q1.](https://preview.redd.it/7n0g32oz8bef1.png?width=600&format=png&auto=webp&s=d31bb77ea496875aa86919a961199b793d099415)

The negative impact from the disruption in China will be the largest in Q2, which suggests a continued slowdown in QoQ growth. $41.5 billion would represent just over 6% growth, and with the current data and outlook, it will serve as the preliminary estimate.

# Gaming Estimate:

The rebound in gaming revenue in Q1 outpaced even the most bullish estimates. The record $3.8 billion in Q1 revenue represented a \~50% QoQ increase and was over 15% higher than the previous record. The report cites strength from the partnership with Nintendo (Switch 2) and the CFO noted, ‚ÄúStrong adoption by gamers, creatives, and AI enthusiasts.‚Äù The gaming beat helped NVDA‚Äôs headline revenue total in Q1, and The Company is optimistic strength will continue. However, given the cyclical nature of gaming and Q1 being such a positive surprise, it is difficult to project further QoQ growth to another record. $3.5 billion in Q2 would achieve 20% YoY growth in this segment and will serve as the preliminary estimate.

[Visualization of Strong Rebound in Gaming Revenue in 2025Q1](https://preview.redd.it/a001knqd9bef1.png?width=600&format=png&auto=webp&s=73ce824ea06d28dd1f08ba742e551b97b7cd20ec)

# Prof. Visualization / Robotics & Auto Estimate:

In the interest of time, and given that these two segments combined for barely over $1 billion in Q1, these two segments are being bundled into one breakdown. Prof. Visualization was mentioned by the CFO on the conference call and is expected to return to QoQ growth after being flat in Q1. Robotics & Auto was down sequentially in Q1 but still up over 70% YoY. There was no mention of expectations in Q2. I currently have \~$1.15 billion for the two segments combined, and will look to fine-tune this closer to the release date.

# Total Revenue Estimate: $46.15 Billion



# Earnings Estimate:

On the Q1 report, NVDA added a Non-GAAP EPS line that specifically excluded the H20 charge. It came in at $0.96 per share, surpassing the consensus of $0.93 but falling $0.01 short of my $0.97 estimate. 

There was some initial confusion surrounding the three metrics as ‚Äúregular‚Äù Non-GAAP EPS came in at $0.81, much higher than the Factset analyst consensus of $0.73. 

In Q2, NVDA will likely return to reporting the standard two EPS metrics, and yahoo finance lists the average estimate from 40 analysts at $1.00 per share. The earnings whisper number is a bit lower at $0.94, while the highest estimate from a single analyst is $1.09. 

While it is relatively easy to find consensus estimates for headline figures like EPS and Total Revenue, most analysts do not break out revenue by segment nor show how they convert top-line revenue to bottom-line profitability. This analysis shows the full process of forecasting revenue by segment and how it translates to the bottom-line in a form of unique transparency. 

The last section established the revenue estimate, but to get to EPS, estimates need to be made for gross margin, operating expenses, non-operating expenses, and total shares outstanding. 

NVDA‚Äôs company-issued guidance for both gross margin and operating expenses has been largely reliable in recent quarters. In Q2, the company expects gross margin of 72% and operating costs of $4 billion, which are used in this estimate. 

The company does not issue guidance for non-operating expenses nor shares outstanding, but accurate estimates can be obtained. 

[Stabilization of Cost Increases in 2024 with uptick in 2025Q1](https://preview.redd.it/ulf2s2nz9bef1.png?width=600&format=png&auto=webp&s=38ed7a3d33b88cfaf4134645ffd638b043f67ca7)

The above graph shows historical data for non-operating expenses and QoQ growth for the segment. The growth rate has largely stabilized compared to previous years, even with an uptick in Q1. $4.0 billion would represent a decrease back to about 5% growth, while my current estimate of $4.1 billion represents an increase of just under 8%.¬†

Estimating shares outstanding can be tricky, as the company‚Äôs share repurchase program is inconsistent. NVDA still has about $25 billion authorized under the current plan for share repurchases, but that is down after aggressive buybacks in Q1.¬†

This analysis estimates about $9 billion in buybacks in Q2, reducing the shares outstanding from 24.61 to 24.55 billion (60m shares @ 150 = $9 B). The estimate is similar to the amount repurchased in Q4 and is lower than repurchases in Q1.¬†  


[EPS Calculation Visualized, While Highlighting Opaqueness of Consensus](https://preview.redd.it/kglfaixaabef1.png?width=1924&format=png&auto=webp&s=8d95f34e8f6bf00b14d87a7d6d645d9e400bb658)

The calculation comes out to $1.02 EPS, which is slightly above the average analyst‚Äôs expectations. $46.15 billion in revenue is also only slightly above the consensus.¬†

This is the closest my estimates have been to the consensus, which has been surpassed each of the last 10 quarters. Given that I expect relatively muted results this quarter, guidance for the rest of the year will be in focus during the call.¬†

# Guidance:

After the positive update on China sales, investors are looking for strong guidance. While it‚Äôs not as straightforward as adding the lost $8 billion back into the forecast, analysts are expecting the worst to be in the past. Investors are looking for signs that the ‚Äústart of the new wave‚Äù Jensen mentioned last quarter will materialize this year.¬†

The current expectation for Q3 revenue is \~$51.5 billion, an increase of 13% from Q2 expectations ($45.55). In Q1, revenue grew 10% QoQ to $44.06 billion. This means analysts expect just over 3% growth in the current quarter with notable re-acceleration in Q3.¬†

Analysts are looking for at least a piece of the Chinese market in Q3 with the $51.5 billion forecast. Q2 guidance would have been closer to $53 billion with full access to China, suggesting the Q3 forecast still projects some disruption in China near term.¬†

If NVDA signals a faster-than-expected ramp in sales to China, guidance expectations that already look strong could still be too low. However, any delays in the licensing process or misaligned inventory could dampen Q3‚Äôs forecast.¬†

# Valuation:

Regardless of belief in the company, NVDA is expensive right now. ‚ÄúExpensive‚Äù in this case means that it is trading at higher multiples than multi-year averages.¬†

Even using the H20 excluded EPS number from Q1, NVDA has earned $3.34 per share over the last four quarters. Trailing earnings are expected to increase to $3.66 after Q2‚Äôs report, while full year EPS is currently expected to come in at around $4.30.¬†

Based on a current price of \~$173, NVDA is currently trading at over 51x TTM earnings, and 40x forward earnings.

While NVDA has previously traded for 40x forward earnings, it has also traded for closer to 20x forward earnings as recently as this year.¬†

NVDA is also currently experiencing an elevated Price to Sales ratio (higher than 75% of history) of over 28x sales, and its Price to Book ratio of 50x is more expensive than 91% of NVDA‚Äôs history.¬†

Buying NVDA at $170 makes sense only if the company continues to deliver bullish surprises on top of already sky-high expectations. I am not selling shares ahead of the report, even with the price outpacing my targets.¬†

# Positions:

When I began posting NVDA analysis and creating my price targets, NVDA traded for about $140 per share. At the time, I felt the price was fair, and it wasn‚Äôt until the liberation day tariff sell-off to sub $90 that I began buying more aggressively.¬†

I currently own 200 shares with a cost basis around $125. While I expected NVDA to recover rather quickly, the near 100% rally from April lows leads me to believe hype and FOMO are driving the price higher rather than fundamental growth. While NVDA‚Äôs growth has been explosive, the current price leaves no room for negative catalysts.¬†

Based on my expectations for NVDA in the rest of 2025, I sold an ATM covered call expiring in December. I am willing to sell at $175 between now and the end of the year, so I decided to collect $3000 ($1500 x2) selling that call option. I now have $15 of downside protection through December or will sell my shares for a massive profit.¬†

This analysis shows the full process of forecasting revenue by segment and how it translates to the bottom-line in a form of unique transparency. 

The last section established the revenue estimate, but to get to EPS, estimates need to be made for gross margin, operating expenses, non-operating expenses, and total shares outstanding. 

NVDA‚Äôs company-issued guidance for both gross margin and operating expenses has been largely reliable in recent quarters. In Q2, the company expects gross margin of 72% and operating costs of $4 billion, which are used in this estimate. 

The company does not issue guidance for non-operating expenses nor shares outstanding, but accurate estimates can be obtained.

The above graph shows historical data for non-operating expenses and QoQ growth for the segment. The growth rate has largely stabilized compared to previous years, even with an uptick in Q1. $4.0 billion would represent a decrease back to about 5% growth, while my current estimate of $4.1 billion represents an increase of just under 8%.¬†

Estimating shares outstanding can be tricky, as the company‚Äôs share repurchase program is inconsistent. NVDA still has about $25 billion authorized under the current plan for share repurchases, but that is down after aggressive buybacks in Q1.¬†

This analysis estimates about $9 billion in buybacks in Q2, reducing the shares outstanding from 24.61 to 24.55 billion (60m shares @ 150 = $9 B). The estimate is similar to the amount repurchased in Q4 and is lower than repurchases in Q1.¬†  


[EPS Calculation Visualized, While Highlighting Opaqueness of Consensus](https://preview.redd.it/kglfaixaabef1.png?width=1924&format=png&auto=webp&s=8d95f34e8f6bf00b14d87a7d6d645d9e400bb658)

The calculation comes out to $1.02 EPS, which is slightly above the average analyst‚Äôs expectations. $46.15 billion in revenue is also only slightly above the consensus.¬†

This is the closest my estimates have been to the consensus, which has been surpassed each of the last 10 quarters. Given that I expect relatively muted results this quarter, guidance for the rest of the year will be in focus during the call.¬†

# Guidance:

After the positive update on China sales, investors are looking for strong guidance. While it‚Äôs not as straightforward as adding the lost $8 billion back into the forecast, analysts are expecting the worst to be in the past. Investors are looking for signs that the ‚Äústart of the new wave‚Äù Jensen mentioned last quarter will materialize this year.¬†

The current expectation for Q3 revenue is \~$51.5 billion, an increase of 13% from Q2 expectations ($45.55). In Q1, revenue grew 10% QoQ to $44.06 billion. This means analysts expect just over 3% growth in the current quarter with notable re-acceleration in Q3.¬†

Analysts are looking for at least a piece of the Chinese market in Q3 with the $51.5 billion forecast. Q2 guidance would have been closer to $53 billion with full access to China, suggesting the Q3 forecast still projects some disruption in China near term.¬†

If NVDA signals a faster-than-expected ramp in sales to China, guidance expectations that already look strong could still be too low. However, any delays in the licensing process or misaligned inventory could dampen Q3‚Äôs forecast.¬†

# Valuation:

Regardless of belief in the company, NVDA is expensive right now. ‚ÄúExpensive‚Äù in this case means that it is trading at higher multiples than multi-year averages.¬†

Even using the H20 excluded EPS number from Q1, NVDA has earned $3.34 per share over the last four quarters. Trailing earnings are expected to increase to $3.66 after Q2‚Äôs report, while full year EPS is currently expected to come in at around $4.30.¬†

Based on a current price of \~$173, NVDA is currently trading at over 51x TTM earnings, and 40x forward earnings.

While NVDA has previously traded for 40x forward earnings, it has also traded for closer to 20x forward earnings as recently as this year.¬†

NVDA is also currently experiencing an elevated Price to Sales ratio (higher than 75% of history) of over 28x sales, and its Price to Book ratio of 50x is more expensive than 91% of NVDA‚Äôs history.¬†

Buying NVDA at $170 makes sense only if the company continues to deliver bullish surprises on top of already sky-high expectations. I am not selling shares ahead of the report, even with the price outpacing my targets.¬†

# Positions:

When I began posting NVDA analysis and creating my price targets, NVDA traded for about $140 per share. At the time, I felt the price was fair, and it wasn‚Äôt until the liberation day tariff sell-off to sub $90 that I began buying more aggressively.¬†

I currently own 200 shares with a cost basis around $125. While I expected NVDA to recover rather quickly, the near 100% rally from April lows leads me to believe hype and FOMO are driving the price higher rather than fundamental growth. While NVDA‚Äôs growth has been explosive, the current price leaves no room for negative catalysts.¬†

Based on my expectations for NVDA in the rest of 2025, I sold an ATM covered call expiring in December. I am willing to sell at $175 between now and the end of the year, so I decided to collect $3000 ($1500 x2) selling that call option. I now have $15 of downside protection through December or will sell my shares for a massive profit.¬†

This is my third consecutive quarter posting an independent analysis of NVDA‚Äôs quarterly earnings. My Q4 FY25 and Q1 FY26 estimates are available on my profile, and a comparison to analyst consensus and actual results in those quarters can be seen below.

[Note 2025Q1 Refers to Non-GAAP H20 Excluded](https://preview.redd.it/mmfycac78bef1.png?width=600&format=png&auto=webp&s=4f6bdebbe39904b4b4e944ef04c1020325685bdf)

[While Analysts Consistently Underestimate Revenue, My Bullish Bias has Decreased Significantly](https://preview.redd.it/zvdf6kug8bef1.png?width=848&format=png&auto=webp&s=bf6b37820b364715f26fbff6c646388c7c67959d)

On last quarter's earnings call, the Company guided for a considerable slowdown in revenue growth. They noted that the forecast included a negative impact of $8 billion from losing access to China. Jensen was particularly open on the call, saying,

‚ÄúOn export control... the platform that wins China is positioned to lead globally. Today, however, the $50 billion China market is effectively closed to U.S. industry.‚Äù

Jensen has been consistently meeting with Trump and his administration to get back into China. As recently as July 14th, NVDA provided a positive update on this disruption in a blog post, telling investors they are going to regain the ability to do so soon. Unfortunately, this will likely not affect revenue in Q2, but could lead to optimism from The Company when issuing guidance for Q3 and beyond.

Like in Q1, I will analyze each of the four main revenue segments and create a combined estimate. Since the Data Center segment is both the largest and in the spotlight, I will start there. 

# Data Center Estimate:

When issuing guidance, Colette Kress (CFO) stated the following: ‚ÄúTotal revenue is expected to be $45 billion, plus or minus 2%. We expect modest sequential growth across all of our platforms. In Data Center, we anticipate the continued ramp of Blackwell to be partially offset by a decline in China revenue.‚Äù  
  
The Blackwell ramp is expected to be completely recognized this quarter, yet the segment is set to only experience ‚Äúmodest growth‚Äù due to being locked out of China. The H20 sales halt hit with about three weeks left in Q1, and revenue grew 9.83% QoQ. NVDA still does not have the license required to sell in China, with less than two weeks left in Q2. A re-acceleration of growth seems unlikely this quarter, and my initial estimate is closer to 5-7% growth (\~$41 to $42 billion).¬†

[The Graph Shows Revenue from Data Centers Since 2024Q1 and Highlights the Deceleration in 2025Q1.](https://preview.redd.it/7n0g32oz8bef1.png?width=600&format=png&auto=webp&s=d31bb77ea496875aa86919a961199b793d099415)

The negative impact from the disruption in China will be the largest in Q2, which suggests a continued slowdown in QoQ growth. $41.5 billion would represent just over 6% growth, and with the current data and outlook, it will serve as the preliminary estimate.

# Gaming Estimate:

The rebound in gaming revenue in Q1 outpaced even the most bullish estimates. The record $3.8 billion in Q1 revenue represented a \~50% QoQ increase and was over 15% higher than the previous record. The report cites strength from the partnership with Nintendo (Switch 2) and the CFO noted, ‚ÄúStrong adoption by gamers, creatives, and AI enthusiasts.‚Äù The gaming beat helped NVDA‚Äôs headline revenue total in Q1, and The Company is optimistic strength will continue. However, given the cyclical nature of gaming and Q1 being such a positive surprise, it is difficult to project further QoQ growth to another record. $3.5 billion in Q2 would achieve 20% YoY growth in this segment and will serve as the preliminary estimate.

[Visualization of Strong Rebound in Gaming Revenue in 2025Q1](https://preview.redd.it/a001knqd9bef1.png?width=600&format=png&auto=webp&s=73ce824ea06d28dd1f08ba742e551b97b7cd20ec)

# Prof. Visualization / Robotics & Auto Estimate:

In the interest of time, and given that these two segments combined for barely over $1 billion in Q1, these two segments are being bundled into one breakdown. Prof. Visualization was mentioned by the CFO on the conference call and is expected to return to QoQ growth after being flat in Q1. Robotics & Auto was down sequentially in Q1 but still up over 70% YoY. There was no mention of expectations in Q2. I currently have \~$1.15 billion for the two segments combined, and will look to fine-tune this closer to the release date.

# Total Revenue Estimate: $46.15 Billion



# Earnings Estimate:

On the Q1 report, NVDA added a Non-GAAP EPS line that specifically excluded the H20 charge. It came in at $0.96 per share, surpassing the consensus of $0.93 but falling $0.01 short of my $0.97 estimate. 

There was some initial confusion surrounding the three metrics as ‚Äúregular‚Äù Non-GAAP EPS came in at $0.81, much higher than the Factset analyst consensus of $0.73. 

In Q2, NVDA will likely return to reporting the standard two EPS metrics, and yahoo finance lists the average estimate from 40 analysts at $1.00 per share. The earnings whisper number is a bit lower at $0.94, while the highest estimate from a single analyst is $1.09. 

While it is relatively easy to find consensus estimates for headline figures like EPS and Total Revenue, most analysts do not break out revenue by segment nor show how they convert top-line revenue to bottom-line profitability. This analysis shows the full process of forecasting revenue by segment and how it translates to the bottom-line in a form of unique transparency.

The above graph shows historical data for non-operating expenses and QoQ growth for the segment. The growth rate has largely stabilized compared to previous years, even with an uptick in Q1. $4.0 billion would represent a decrease back to about 5% growth, while my current estimate of $4.1 billion represents an increase of just under 8%.¬†

This is my third consecutive quarter posting an independent analysis of NVDA‚Äôs quarterly earnings. My Q4 FY25 and Q1 FY26 estimates are available on my profile, and a comparison to analyst consensus and actual results in those quarters can be seen below.

[Note 2025Q1 Refers to Non-GAAP H20 Excluded](https://preview.redd.it/mmfycac78bef1.png?width=600&format=png&auto=webp&s=4f6bdebbe39904b4b4e944ef04c1020325685bdf)

On last quarter's earnings call, the Company guided for a considerable slowdown in revenue growth. They noted that the forecast included a negative impact of $8 billion from losing access to China. Jensen was particularly open on the call, saying,

‚ÄúOn export control... the platform that wins China is positioned to lead globally. Today, however, the $50 billion China market is effectively closed to U.S. industry.‚Äù

Jensen has been consistently meeting with Trump and his administration to get back into China. As recently as July 14th, NVDA provided a positive update on this disruption in a blog post, telling investors they are going to regain the ability to do so soon. Unfortunately, this will likely not affect revenue in Q2, but could lead to optimism from The Company when issuing guidance for Q3 and beyond.

Like in Q1, I will analyze each of the four main revenue segments and create a combined estimate. Since the Data Center segment is both the largest and in the spotlight, I will start there. 

# Data Center Estimate:

When issuing guidance, Colette Kress (CFO) stated the following: ‚ÄúTotal revenue is expected to be $45 billion, plus or minus 2%. We expect modest sequential growth across all of our platforms. In Data Center, we anticipate the continued ramp of Blackwell to be partially offset by a decline in China revenue.‚Äù  
  
The Blackwell ramp is expected to be completely recognized this quarter, yet the segment is set to only experience ‚Äúmodest growth‚Äù due to being locked out of China. The H20 sales halt hit with about three weeks left in Q1, and revenue grew 9.83% QoQ. NVDA still does not have the license required to sell in China, with less than two weeks left in Q2. A re-acceleration of growth seems unlikely this quarter, and my initial estimate is closer to 5-7% growth (\~$41 to $42 billion).¬†

[The Graph Shows Revenue from Data Centers Since 2024Q1 and Highlights the Deceleration in 2025Q1.](https://preview.redd.it/7n0g32oz8bef1.png?width=600&format=png&auto=webp&s=d31bb77ea496875aa86919a961199b793d099415)

The negative impact from the disruption in China will be the largest in Q2, which suggests a continued slowdown in QoQ growth. $41.5 billion would represent just over 6% growth, and with the current data and outlook, it will serve as the preliminary estimate.

# Gaming Estimate:

The rebound in gaming revenue in Q1 outpaced even the most bullish estimates. The record $3.8 billion in Q1 revenue represented a \~50% QoQ increase and was over 15% higher than the previous record. The report cites strength from the partnership with Nintendo (Switch 2) and the CFO noted, ‚ÄúStrong adoption by gamers, creatives, and AI enthusiasts.‚Äù The gaming beat helped NVDA‚Äôs headline revenue total in Q1, and The Company is optimistic strength will continue. However, given the cyclical nature of gaming and Q1 being such a positive surprise, it is difficult to project further QoQ growth to another record. $3.5 billion in Q2 would achieve 20% YoY growth in this segment and will serve as the preliminary estimate.

[Visualization of Strong Rebound in Gaming Revenue in 2025Q1](https://preview.redd.it/a001knqd9bef1.png?width=600&format=png&auto=webp&s=73ce824ea06d28dd1f08ba742e551b97b7cd20ec)

# Prof. Visualization / Robotics & Auto Estimate:

In the interest of time, and given that these two segments combined for barely over $1 billion in Q1, these two segments are being bundled into one breakdown. Prof. Visualization was mentioned by the CFO on the conference call and is expected to return to QoQ growth after being flat in Q1. Robotics & Auto was down sequentially in Q1 but still up over 70% YoY. There was no mention of expectations in Q2. I currently have \~$1.15 billion for the two segments combined, and will look to fine-tune this closer to the release date.

# Total Revenue Estimate: $46.15 Billion



# Earnings Estimate:

On the Q1 report, NVDA added a Non-GAAP EPS line that specifically excluded the H20 charge. It came in at $0.96 per share, surpassing the consensus of $0.93 but falling $0.01 short of my $0.97 estimate. 

There was some initial confusion surrounding the three metrics as ‚Äúregular‚Äù Non-GAAP EPS came in at $0.81, much higher than the Factset analyst consensus of $0.73. 

In Q2, NVDA will likely return to reporting the standard two EPS metrics, and yahoo finance lists the average estimate from 40 analysts at $1.00 per share. The earnings whisper number is a bit lower at $0.94, while the highest estimate from a single analyst is $1.09. 

While it is relatively easy to find consensus estimates for headline figures like EPS and Total Revenue, most analysts do not break out revenue by segment nor show how they convert top-line revenue to bottom-line profitability. This analysis shows the full process of forecasting revenue by segment and how it translates to the bottom-line in a form of unique transparency. 

The last section established the revenue estimate, but to get to EPS, estimates need to be made for gross margin, operating expenses, non-operating expenses, and total shares outstanding. 

NVDA‚Äôs company-issued guidance for both gross margin and operating expenses has been largely reliable in recent quarters. In Q2, the company expects gross margin of 72% and operating costs of $4 billion, which are used in this estimate. 

The company does not issue guidance for non-operating expenses nor shares outstanding, but accurate estimates can be obtained. 

[Stabilization of Cost Increases in 2024 with uptick in 2025Q1](https://preview.redd.it/ulf2s2nz9bef1.png?width=600&format=png&auto=webp&s=38ed7a3d33b88cfaf4134645ffd638b043f67ca7)

The above graph shows historical data for non-operating expenses and QoQ growth for the segment. The growth rate has largely stabilized compared to previous years, even with an uptick in Q1. $4.0 billion would represent a decrease back to about 5% growth, while my current estimate of $4.1 billion represents an increase of just under 8%.¬†

Estimating shares outstanding can be tricky, as the company‚Äôs share repurchase program is inconsistent. NVDA still has about $25 billion authorized under the current plan for share repurchases, but that is down after aggressive buybacks in Q1.¬†

This analysis estimates about $9 billion in buybacks in Q2, reducing the shares outstanding from 24.61 to 24.55 billion (60m shares @ 150 = $9 B). The estimate is similar to the amount repurchased in Q4 and is lower than repurchases in Q1.¬†  


[EPS Calculation Visualized, While Highlighting Opaqueness of Consensus](https://preview.redd.it/kglfaixaabef1.png?width=1924&format=png&auto=webp&s=8d95f34e8f6bf00b14d87a7d6d645d9e400bb658)

The calculation comes out to $1.02 EPS, which is slightly above the average analyst‚Äôs expectations. $46.15 billion in revenue is also only slightly above the consensus.¬†

This is the closest my estimates have been to the consensus, which has been surpassed each of the last 10 quarters. Given that I expect relatively muted results this quarter, guidance for the rest of the year will be in focus during the call.¬†

# Guidance:

After the positive update on China sales, investors are looking for strong guidance. While it‚Äôs not as straightforward as adding the lost $8 billion back into the forecast, analysts are expecting the worst to be in the past. Investors are looking for signs that the ‚Äústart of the new wave‚Äù Jensen mentioned last quarter will materialize this year.¬†

The current expectation for Q3 revenue is \~$51.5 billion, an increase of 13% from Q2 expectations ($45.55). In Q1, revenue grew 10% QoQ to $44.06 billion. This means analysts expect just over 3% growth in the current quarter with notable re-acceleration in Q3.¬†

Analysts are looking for at least a piece of the Chinese market in Q3 with the $51.5 billion forecast. Q2 guidance would have been closer to $53 billion with full access to China, suggesting the Q3 forecast still projects some disruption in China near term.¬†

If NVDA signals a faster-than-expected ramp in sales to China, guidance expectations that already look strong could still be too low. However, any delays in the licensing process or misaligned inventory could dampen Q3‚Äôs forecast.¬†

# Valuation:

Regardless of belief in the company, NVDA is expensive right now. ‚ÄúExpensive‚Äù in this case means that it is trading at higher multiples than multi-year averages.¬†

Even using the H20 excluded EPS number from Q1, NVDA has earned $3.34 per share over the last four quarters. Trailing earnings are expected to increase to $3.66 after Q2‚Äôs report, while full year EPS is currently expected to come in at around $4.30.¬†

Based on a current price of \~$173, NVDA is currently trading at over 51x TTM earnings, and 40x forward earnings.

While NVDA has previously traded for 40x forward earnings, it has also traded for closer to 20x forward earnings as recently as this year.¬†

NVDA is also currently experiencing an elevated Price to Sales ratio (higher than 75% of history) of over 28x sales, and its Price to Book ratio of 50x is more expensive than 91% of NVDA‚Äôs history.¬†

Buying NVDA at $170 makes sense only if the company continues to deliver bullish surprises on top of already sky-high expectations. I am not selling shares ahead of the report, even with the price outpacing my targets.¬†

# Positions:

When I began posting NVDA analysis and creating my price targets, NVDA traded for about $140 per share. At the time, I felt the price was fair, and it wasn‚Äôt until the liberation day tariff sell-off to sub $90 that I began buying more aggressively.¬†

I currently own 200 shares with a cost basis around $125. While I expected NVDA to recover rather quickly, the near 100% rally from April lows leads me to believe hype and FOMO are driving the price higher rather than fundamental growth. While NVDA‚Äôs growth has been explosive, the current price leaves no room for negative catalysts.¬†

Based on my expectations for NVDA in the rest of 2025, I sold an ATM covered call expiring in December. I am willing to sell at $175 between now and the end of the year, so I decided to collect $3000 ($1500 x2) selling that call option. I now have $15 of downside protection through December or will sell my shares for a massive profit.¬†

On the Q1 report, NVDA added a Non-GAAP EPS line that specifically excluded the H20 charge. It came in at $0.96 per share, surpassing the consensus of $0.93 but falling $0.01 short of my $0.97 estimate. 

There was some initial confusion surrounding the three metrics as ‚Äúregular‚Äù Non-GAAP EPS came in at $0.81, much higher than the Factset analyst consensus of $0.73. 

In Q2, NVDA will likely return to reporting the standard two EPS metrics, and yahoo finance lists the average estimate from 40 analysts at $1.00 per share. The earnings whisper number is a bit lower at $0.94, while the highest estimate from a single analyst is $1.09. 

While it is relatively easy to find consensus estimates for headline figures like EPS and Total Revenue, most analysts do not break out revenue by segment nor show how they convert top-line revenue to bottom-line profitability. This analysis shows the full process of forecasting revenue by segment and how it translates to the bottom-line in a form of unique transparency. 

The last section established the revenue estimate, but to get to EPS, estimates need to be made for gross margin, operating expenses, non-operating expenses, and total shares outstanding. 

NVDA‚Äôs company-issued guidance for both gross margin and operating expenses has been largely reliable in recent quarters. In Q2, the company expects gross margin of 72% and operating costs of $4 billion, which are used in this estimate. 

The company does not issue guidance for non-operating expenses nor shares outstanding, but accurate estimates can be obtained.

The above graph shows historical data for non-operating expenses and QoQ growth for the segment. The growth rate has largely stabilized compared to previous years, even with an uptick in Q1. $4.0 billion would represent a decrease back to about 5% growth, while my current estimate of $4.1 billion represents an increase of just under 8%.¬†

Estimating shares outstanding can be tricky, as the company‚Äôs share repurchase program is inconsistent. NVDA still has about $25 billion authorized under the current plan for share repurchases, but that is down after aggressive buybacks in Q1.¬†

This analysis estimates about $9 billion in buybacks in Q2, reducing the shares outstanding from 24.61 to 24.55 billion (60m shares @ 150 = $9 B). The estimate is similar to the amount repurchased in Q4 and is lower than repurchases in Q1.¬†

The calculation comes out to $1.02 EPS, which is slightly above the average analyst‚Äôs expectations. $46.15 billion in revenue is also only slightly above the consensus.¬†

This is the closest my estimates have been to the consensus, which has been surpassed each of the last 10 quarters. Given that I expect relatively muted results this quarter, guidance for the rest of the year will be in focus during the call.¬†

# Guidance:

After the positive update on China sales, investors are looking for strong guidance. While it‚Äôs not as straightforward as adding the lost $8 billion back into the forecast, analysts are expecting the worst to be in the past. Investors are looking for signs that the ‚Äústart of the new wave‚Äù Jensen mentioned last quarter will materialize this year.¬†

The current expectation for Q3 revenue is \~$51.5 billion, an increase of 13% from Q2 expectations ($45.55). In Q1, revenue grew 10% QoQ to $44.06 billion. This means analysts expect just over 3% growth in the current quarter with notable re-acceleration in Q3.¬†

Analysts are looking for at least a piece of the Chinese market in Q3 with the $51.5 billion forecast. Q2 guidance would have been closer to $53 billion with full access to China, suggesting the Q3 forecast still projects some disruption in China near term.¬†

If NVDA signals a faster-than-expected ramp in sales to China, guidance expectations that already look strong could still be too low. However, any delays in the licensing process or misaligned inventory could dampen Q3‚Äôs forecast.¬†

# Valuation:

Regardless of belief in the company, NVDA is expensive right now. ‚ÄúExpensive‚Äù in this case means that it is trading at higher multiples than multi-year averages.¬†

Even using the H20 excluded EPS number from Q1, NVDA has earned $3.34 per share over the last four quarters. Trailing earnings are expected to increase to $3.66 after Q2‚Äôs report, while full year EPS is currently expected to come in at around $4.30.¬†

Based on a current price of \~$173, NVDA is currently trading at over 51x TTM earnings, and 40x forward earnings.

While NVDA has previously traded for 40x forward earnings, it has also traded for closer to 20x forward earnings as recently as this year.¬†

NVDA is also currently experiencing an elevated Price to Sales ratio (higher than 75% of history) of over 28x sales, and its Price to Book ratio of 50x is more expensive than 91% of NVDA‚Äôs history.¬†

Buying NVDA at $170 makes sense only if the company continues to deliver bullish surprises on top of already sky-high expectations. I am not selling shares ahead of the report, even with the price outpacing my targets.¬†

# Positions:

When I began posting NVDA analysis and creating my price targets, NVDA traded for about $140 per share. At the time, I felt the price was fair, and it wasn‚Äôt until the liberation day tariff sell-off to sub $90 that I began buying more aggressively.¬†

I currently own 200 shares with a cost basis around $125. While I expected NVDA to recover rather quickly, the near 100% rally from April lows leads me to believe hype and FOMO are driving the price higher rather than fundamental growth. While NVDA‚Äôs growth has been explosive, the current price leaves no room for negative catalysts.¬†

Based on my expectations for NVDA in the rest of 2025, I sold an ATM covered call expiring in December. I am willing to sell at $175 between now and the end of the year, so I decided to collect $3000 ($1500 x2) selling that call option. I now have $15 of downside protection through December or will sell my shares for a massive profit.¬†

This is my third consecutive quarter posting an independent analysis of NVDA‚Äôs quarterly earnings. My Q4 FY25 and Q1 FY26 estimates are available on my profile, and a comparison to analyst consensus and actual results in those quarters can be seen below.

[Note 2025Q1 Refers to Non-GAAP H20 Excluded](https://preview.redd.it/mmfycac78bef1.png?width=600&format=png&auto=webp&s=4f6bdebbe39904b4b4e944ef04c1020325685bdf)

[While Analysts Consistently Underestimate Revenue, My Bullish Bias has Decreased Significantly](https://preview.redd.it/zvdf6kug8bef1.png?width=848&format=png&auto=webp&s=bf6b37820b364715f26fbff6c646388c7c67959d)

On last quarter's earnings call, the Company guided for a considerable slowdown in revenue growth. They noted that the forecast included a negative impact of $8 billion from losing access to China. Jensen was particularly open on the call, saying,

‚ÄúOn export control... the platform that wins China is positioned to lead globally. Today, however, the $50 billion China market is effectively closed to U.S. industry.‚Äù

Jensen has been consistently meeting with Trump and his administration to get back into China. As recently as July 14th, NVDA provided a positive update on this disruption in a blog post, telling investors they are going to regain the ability to do so soon. Unfortunately, this will likely not affect revenue in Q2, but could lead to optimism from The Company when issuing guidance for Q3 and beyond.

Like in Q1, I will analyze each of the four main revenue segments and create a combined estimate. Since the Data Center segment is both the largest and in the spotlight, I will start there. 

# Data Center Estimate:

When issuing guidance, Colette Kress (CFO) stated the following: ‚ÄúTotal revenue is expected to be $45 billion, plus or minus 2%. We expect modest sequential growth across all of our platforms. In Data Center, we anticipate the continued ramp of Blackwell to be partially offset by a decline in China revenue.‚Äù  
  
The Blackwell ramp is expected to be completely recognized this quarter, yet the segment is set to only experience ‚Äúmodest growth‚Äù due to being locked out of China. The H20 sales halt hit with about three weeks left in Q1, and revenue grew 9.83% QoQ. NVDA still does not have the license required to sell in China, with less than two weeks left in Q2. A re-acceleration of growth seems unlikely this quarter, and my initial estimate is closer to 5-7% growth (\~$41 to $42 billion).¬†

[The Graph Shows Revenue from Data Centers Since 2024Q1 and Highlights the Deceleration in 2025Q1.](https://preview.redd.it/7n0g32oz8bef1.png?width=600&format=png&auto=webp&s=d31bb77ea496875aa86919a961199b793d099415)

The negative impact from the disruption in China will be the largest in Q2, which suggests a continued slowdown in QoQ growth. $41.5 billion would represent just over 6% growth, and with the current data and outlook, it will serve as the preliminary estimate.

# Gaming Estimate:

The rebound in gaming revenue in Q1 outpaced even the most bullish estimates. The record $3.8 billion in Q1 revenue represented a \~50% QoQ increase and was over 15% higher than the previous record. The report cites strength from the partnership with Nintendo (Switch 2) and the CFO noted, ‚ÄúStrong adoption by gamers, creatives, and AI enthusiasts.‚Äù The gaming beat helped NVDA‚Äôs headline revenue total in Q1, and The Company is optimistic strength will continue. However, given the cyclical nature of gaming and Q1 being such a positive surprise, it is difficult to project further QoQ growth to another record. $3.5 billion in Q2 would achieve 20% YoY growth in this segment and will serve as the preliminary estimate.

# Prof. Visualization / Robotics & Auto Estimate:

In the interest of time, and given that these two segments combined for barely over $1 billion in Q1, these two segments are being bundled into one breakdown. Prof. Visualization was mentioned by the CFO on the conference call and is expected to return to QoQ growth after being flat in Q1. Robotics & Auto was down sequentially in Q1 but still up over 70% YoY. There was no mention of expectations in Q2. I currently have \~$1.15 billion for the two segments combined, and will look to fine-tune this closer to the release date.

# Total Revenue Estimate: $46.15 Billion



# Earnings Estimate:

On the Q1 report, NVDA added a Non-GAAP EPS line that specifically excluded the H20 charge. It came in at $0.96 per share, surpassing the consensus of $0.93 but falling $0.01 short of my $0.97 estimate.

Based on my expectations for NVDA in the rest of 2025, I sold an ATM covered call expiring in December. I am willing to sell at $175 between now and the end of the year, so I decided to collect $3000 ($1500 x2) selling that call option. I now have $15 of downside protection through December or will sell my shares for a massive profit.¬†

After accurately predicting the sharp market crash in March earlier this year, I now believe we‚Äôre once again on the brink of a major downturn.

NVDA,2025-07-23,US,"Gold probably entering bear market soon It bothers me to see advertisements for investments. Just remember nothing worth buying needs to be advertised.

Gold at these prices will not hedge anything or protect your investments. Even if Gold went to $4000/oz that's only a 15% gain, which is a sneeze for NVDA etc. 15% isn't enough to protect a full equity portfolio and is nothing compared to where bonds will go in a market crash.

Either way the monthly slow stochastic is the poker-tell on gold going back to the beginning when the gold window was closed. So there's no reason not to believe it now. When slow stochastic falls below 80 on the monthly chart that's always been the top. We're getting there soon by the current trajectory. One more month of no new high would meet the criteria.

The linear regression is maxed out, gold only breaks the monthly linear regression at tops as well and it broke above a couple months ago and never made a new high since, just like all previous tops before major bear markets.

I will short Gold when it loses the monthly slow stochastic at 80. That'll signal a new gold bear market and those can last 10+ years.

I'd buy gold back at $2300/oz or below. || I have a moderately aggressive investing strategy and done well. I am now nervous about weaker dollar coupled with ‚Äòirrational exuberance‚Äô. Want to lock in profits Want to exit the rash NVDA and PLTR world for now.

S&P value via SPLV (30%)

SGOV is ultra-short duration Treasury exposure. There might be better alternatives out there. Any suggestions are appreciated. || Going Back to School ‚Äì $64k to Invest I'm returning to school soon, and the cost will be about $36k per year after scholarships. I currently have around $100k in cash. 

My original plan was to roll the funds through short term T-bills while attending school which would be risk free and yield decent returns. However, I'm exploring the idea of allocating the remaining $64k (after paying for the first year) into one or two solid companies that could see solid upside in the next 2/3 years. If everything goes well, I would then liquidate a portion of the position for each payment period (after 1 year). The school provides 4 payment periods throughout each semester thankfully.

I‚Äôm mainly considering large-cap names that I believe are either fairly valued or potentially undervalued. AAPL, GOOGL, and LLY are on my radar. MSFT is also in the mix as a durable compounder. I‚Äôm intentionally avoiding anything too speculative or volatile (like TSLA or NVDA), and I‚Äôm not looking at mid-cap or high-beta plays.

Are there any companies this community sees as fitting into this plan or should I likely stick with fixed income? I would greatly appreciate any insights or ideas on where you‚Äôd look if you were in a similar situation.

 Thank you.  || Over exposed to a single stocks? Hi everyone. 

I‚Äôm hoping a discussion on when, how and why shifting investments could or could not be the right thing to do. Especially when taking profits to move them elsewhere. 

Is it smart to hold stocks in companies you‚Äôre already exposed to in an ETF? 

For example, if you had 100k USD and your portfolio resembles the below. (Hypothetical) 

VOO - 30% 
NVDA - 40% 
META - 30%

 ‚Ä¢ Would this be considered over exposed? 

‚Ä¢ Would it be beneficial to move everything into an ETF that has exposure to NVDA & META among other things? 

‚Ä¢ Would you see greater growth out of your 100k in one place? 

‚Ä¢ If you were to sell individual holdings, for considerable gains opening you up for tax obligations how would this affect your decision? 

I understand that investing is a personal journey and decisions are based off your own risk tolerance, time frame, goals, etc. I would just like to hear some discussion of those who have navigated this in the past.

 || Is 75% Net Income spent on CAPEX too much for GOOG? In April the narrative was ""Tech is spending too much on CAPEX"". It really impacted companies like MSFT and NVDA which at the time was the right call to call that bluff.

But now, with GOOG coming out declaring it wants to spend upwards of 75% of its net income on CAPEX. Is it too much going forward?

GOOG's CAPEX has increased from a 49% average pre 2016, to a current average of 54.2% of its net income. But now it wants to spend nearly 75% for estimated 2025 Net income. And says it'll increase even more in 2026.

While it is still a subject of debate, tokenization's potential to drastically reshape the investing landscape has drawn strong interest.
It is being touted as the next breakthrough for bridging the gap between traditional and digital finance, with supporters saying it could open up an asset class that has long been out of reach for retail investors.


""We're at the precipice of doing something very special, and that's really the democratization of markets,"" said Chris Perkins, president of crypto investment firm CoinFund.
The growing interest in tokenization coincides with the renewed optimism in the crypto industry, which has rallied in recent months and gained momentum after the Genius Act was passed earlier this month.

Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

But growth stocks don't rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count:  Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future.

Value stocks do rely on earnings reports, investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS & revenue.  You'll also find value stocks pay dividends, but never invest in a company solely for its dividend.

PEG,2025-07-20,US,"Nvidia Will Continue Controlling The AI Board Nvidia is the 'queen' of the AI ecosystem, dominating hardware, software, and systems and controlling key segments from training to inference and networking.

Unmatched AI leadership, explosive revenue growth, and strategic partnerships with players like Astera Labs, Credo, and Super Micro Computer reinforce Nvidia's central role.

China market access and the Omniverse platform provide significant new growth drivers, supporting a strong 12-24 month growth outlook and a buy rating.

Despite high absolute valuation multiples, Nvidia's rapid growth and favorable PEG ratios make it attractive versus peers; the main risk is US-China geopolitical tension.

I believe these companies are well-positioned in the AI ecosystem, but I realise that one piece is missing: the queen. Just like in a game of chess, the queen is the most powerful and versatile piece on the board. It can move in any direction (horizontal, vertical, and diagonal) and quickly cover a wide area. That is why I believe it is a perfect fit for NVIDIA (NVDA). I say this because it dominates both offensively and defensively. Just as the queen controls most of the board, NVDA controls the most valuable parts of the AI infrastructure, from training to inference, simulation, and networking. Secondly, it is versatile and critical because it spans hardware, software, and systems. This is cool because few participants can match its breadth and influence. Finally, it leverages strategic partnerships. I mean, just as the queen commands pawns, rooks, and bishops, NVDA integrates system builders (such as Super Micro Computer (SMCI)), connectivity providers (such as Credo Technology Group (CRDO) and Astera Labs (ALAB)), and government AI programmes to expand its control over the AI battlefield.

So why is the queen so special?

Well, several factors set Nvidia apart. First and foremost, it holds an unparalleled leadership position in the AI field, thanks to the combination of hardware, software, and ecosystem advantages. Its Blackwell GPU architecture makes it uniquely special. Combined with the Omniverse simulation platform, we are driving self-reinforcing AI, which is driving explosive growth. For example, in the first quarter of the 2026 fiscal year, NVDA achieved revenue of $44.1 billion, representing a year over year increase of 69%. Data centre revenue reached $39.1 billion, up 73%. Some of Nvidia's key customers such as Microsoft , Google  OpenAI, and Meta  deploy tens of thousands of Nvidia's latest GPUs each quarter. For example, according to SA Weebler Finance data, hyperscale data centre operators are running approximately 1,000 NVLink rack systems (about 72,000 GPUs) per week, with further increases expected. Ideally, this means Nvidia's data centre run rate in the AI computing sector has exceeded $170 billion annually.

Secondly, NVDA's stack is also expanding beyond GPUs. As I mentioned, its global industrial simulation platform is now being used to digitise entire factories and cities. In fact, the platform has evolved to support critical infrastructure. Original equipment manufacturers like BMW are running over 30 virtual factories on the platform to optimise production in advance. As each AI solution requires an increasing amount of synthetic training data, NVDA's end-to-end solutions form an unparalleled moat. Ideally, this platform means more users generating more simulation data, ultimately driving demand for more Nvidia computing resources. What I see is that NVDA is now at the centre of the AI value chain.

Finally, the U.S. has approved the resumption of exports of NVIDIA H20 AI GPUs to China. This means NVIDIA will be able to access China's potential market, which is significant. According to a Morgan Stanley report, China's AI market is expected to reach $1.4 trillion by 2030.

China has been systematically implementing a long-term strategy to build its domestic artificial intelligence capabilities. Its strong academic foundation, innovative methods, data, talent, and growing foreign investment are driving it toward becoming a leading artificial intelligence powerhouse...

‚Äò...China is less concerned with building the most powerful AI capabilities and more focused on bringing AI to market. China embraces open-source AI, while the United States appears to be moving toward closed, tightly controlled AI systems...‚Äô

‚Äò...The next 6 to 12 months will be a critical period for Chinese AI companies, as more and more deployments aimed at solving real-world problems begin to demonstrate productivity gains.‚Äô

Due to this milestone, NVDA's Jensen Huang estimates that NVDA's potential market size  in China will reach $50 billion. This means that China's spending on AI will increase, and Nvidia's growth prospects are expected to be stronger than ever before. I expect this growth outlook to be reflected in the upcoming quarterly earnings report to be released on 27 August 2025.

These factors combined will undoubtedly accelerate Nvidia's growth trajectory over the next 12 to 24 months. Therefore, I assign a ‚ÄòBuy‚Äô rating to Nvidia Corporation.

Nvidia's AI Ecosystem

Having highlighted the case for NVDA, I would like to connect it to some AI components I have researched previously. Some of these AI companies have remarkable growth prospects and are expected to align their growth trajectories with NVDA. Additionally, the connections between NVDA and these AI companies will help us better understand NVDA's future direction.

First, Astera Labs  is a leading connectivity chip company that recently went public in 2024. ALAB's chips support scalable and low-latency GPU rack interconnects. For more information on Astera Labs and its chips, please refer to Article 1 and Article 2. Now, Nvidia has publicly announced its collaboration with Astera on NVLink Fusion. This collaboration expands NVDA's total addressable market (TAM).

There is also Credo Technology, which is known for its active cables  re-timers, and SerDes chips. According to SA Oakoff Investments, most hyperscale computing vendors now consider CRDO's AEC to be the de facto standard for in-rack links. This means that AEC cables are the infrastructure required for NVDA's 72-GPU Blackwell rack.

Third, Super Micro Computer  and Celestica  manufacture and sell GPU racks and systems using NVDA technology. Nvidia currently provides complete data centre racks containing tens of thousands of GPUs, which are delivered to system builders like SMCI and CLS. They then collaborate with NVDA to package and sell these racks to hyperscale customers such as Microsoft, Meta, and Amazon. For more information, please refer to this article from SMCI and this article from Celestica.

In summary, these partnerships demonstrate NVIDIA's connectivity within the AI ecosystem. This confirms that NVIDIA is indeed the queen of the AI chessboard.

For a company with a market capitalisation of 4.22 trillion dollars, it still has significant growth opportunities, particularly in the Chinese market, which means there is much to watch for with NVIDIA. Additionally, I note that NVIDIA has an A- growth rating, as shown in the figure below. The company's expected revenue growth rate is 60.71%, while the industry median is 7.28%. Furthermore, its 3-5 year compound annual growth rate  for expected long-term earnings per share  growth is 29.09%, compared to the industry median of 14.29%. This clearly indicates the expected growth levels for certain potential AI opportunities, such as the Omniverse platform and the Chinese AI market.

Now, when it comes to valuation, the growth outlook is becoming clearer. First, when I look at the chart below, I notice that most metrics are above the industry median, indicating that the valuation is higher than the industry median. Its non-GAAP forward price-to-earnings ratio is 40.12 times, and its forward enterprise value to EBITDA ratio is 34.79 times, both significantly higher than the industry median. However, when I look at the non-GAAP forward price-to-earnings ratio , it indicates that the valuation is undervalued by 27%. NVDA's price-to-earnings ratio is 1.38 times, while the industry median is 1.90 times. Based on the GAAP trailing 12-month PEG, the company's P/E ratio is 0.69 times, undervalued by 31% compared to the industry median. Ideally, I would say that most multiples look high in absolute terms, but compared to NVDA's 60.71% compound annual growth rate, the stock's valuation isn't as high as it appears.

In terms of peer comparison, I chose NVDA's closest competitors because Nvidia is already far ahead in terms of market capitalisation, so I chose Broadcom and AMD. I noticed that NVDA's price-to-earnings ratio and expected price-to-earnings ratio are still lower than its peers.

I believe that the biggest risk facing NVIDIA at present is geopolitical risk. Currently, there are many uncertainties between China and the United States, especially following the imposition of tariffs on Liberation Day and the U.S. government's decision to suspend exports of H20 GPUs to China. Such situations could recur and undermine NVIDIA's growth plans and market expansion efforts. Losing the Chinese market would have a significant impact on NVIDIA's business. Additionally, geopolitical events such as trade tariffs and sanctions could affect global supply or cloud computing spending in some of the key regions where NVIDIA operates. In conclusion, in this grand AI infrastructure game, NVIDIA is the queen. Currently, it is the most powerful and flexible piece on the board. Compared to peers that may occupy other key positions, NVIDIA controls every direction. For example, AMD is the rook, SMCI is the bishop, while Credo and Astera are agile knights. Ultimately, NVIDIA determines the pace and scope of this game. As AI demand continues to grow, NVIDIA's dominant position is further strengthened by the expansion of the Chinese market. || Nvidia Will Continue Controlling The AI Board Nvidia is the 'queen' of the AI ecosystem, dominating hardware, software, and systems and controlling key segments from training to inference and networking.

Fire away!
 || Not all top 10 tech stocks are the same A lot is being said about the high valuations and long outperformance of the tech stocks and how risky and overvalued they are as a bunch. But there's an enormous difference just among the top 10 tech stocks by size.

TSLA is trading at a PE of 177 which doesn't make the remotest bit of sense based on the business that they are in (cars) and could be in (robotaxis, robots, and AI), even if they were wildly successful in new business areas (in which they face stiff competition) there is no way to justify the current valuation.

PLTR's PE is over 600 not much more I need to say about that.

GOOG is trading at a PE of 21. Its core search business is going to be disrupted by AI but it is still entrenched and they have the time and resources to adapt. Meanwhile they own the largest streaming platform in YouTube, and arguably the most actually successful robotaxi business in Waymo. If they were ever split up the parts would be worth far more than the sum.

AAPL's heyday is behind it since their growth is anchored in devices and they will probably never acquire significantly more market share in phones meanwhile they have to create a new Fortune 500 sized business every year just to try to keep the growth going.

AMZN on the other hand is not bound by any particular industry or market. They are getting into satellites, pharmaceutical delivery, health care, and can pick any large market they want to address.

MSFT's new leadership after the atrocious Ballmer has brought the company into huge new markets and they are well positioned to capitalize on AI, with a PE of 39 they are not cheap but by far not the most expensive with solid growth prospects.

I personally think that social media is a scourge upon the earth and is destroying the minds of young and old people alike, but META has essentially monopolies that will not be disrupted. 

Meanwhile these companies are investing nearly $300 billion in cap ex per year and have returned nearly $1 trillion to shareholders in buybacks and dividends over the past 5 years. These aren't unprofitable ""dot com bubble"" stocks but entrenched cash cows. || PLTR gains, even after recouping cost basis twice over \>800%!

PWR,2025-07-21,US,"AI Action Day This Wednesday I posted a couple days ago expressing my view that money can be made by being on top of trump's agenda, policy-related news, etc. I'm not saying its easy, but I think in several instances so far this year, the ""puzzle pieces"" have been out there, and if you put them together, you could have positioned ahead of the news. MP was one i mentioned in my previous post but there have been others.

To get to the point... There is an ""AI Action Day"" event happening on Wednesday. Hosted by All-In podcast people (David Sachs) and with various tech leaders in attendance as well as Trump of course.  Supposedly this will be an announcement of a larger strategy to promote US AI dominance. I would bet that there are opportunities here. Not clear if there is a home run, but I think a smart person could figure out a smart way to play this.

Unfortunately, I'm not a smart person, but maybe collectively as a group of not-smart people, we can figure out some plays here.

I can't link sources for some reason, keeps deleting my post, but you guys can google more information regarding the event if you want. TLDR It's being hosted

Technology leaders participating in the event include **Chris Power, CEO of Hadrian**; **Shyam Sankar, CTO of Palantir**; **Paul Buchheit, Partner at YCombinator; James Litinsky, CEO of MP Materials; Lisa Su, CEO of AMD.**

Additional speakers are still being confirmed.

I don't think the obvious choices are going to move much here. NVDA is already up significantly and i don't expect any announcements big enough to move a 4 trillion market cap... The easing of chip restrictions is also already priced in now. I expected this will be touched on at the event, but it's no longer news.

Spitballing but a few ideas:

I think energy will be a major focus of any strategy announcement. This is an area that is critically important for AI, and an area where the US is SIGNIFICANTLY lagging China. I'm not too sure how this could be played, but I'm considering EQT. I was looking at them last week due to the PA AI event. The stock didn't move much unfortunately, but all of nat gas seems to have struggled to close the week for whatever reason. By no means an expert here, but EQT has a major grift angle in that their CEO is closely tied to the republican party/trump.

Datacenter buildout: PWR, ACM, FLR - not really sure here. Chatgpt helped me on this one. Maybe APLD? Could be some type of policy/tax incentive to stimulate datacenter construction. not that its really needed at this point...

They have a pipeline though and the most notable drug is a glp1 (semaglutide) combined with a myostatin deficiency creator drug, it blocks myostatin>

Myostatin is important because it tells ur muscles to stop growing for no reason.  Its why we dont all walk around insanely jacked.

Think of it like steroids except they dont effect ur organs or hormones and u dont have to work out and u get jacked as fuck.

P1 went insane on MONKEYS LOL, it started to trend on obscure fitness tik tok, and the #1 fitness utuber is getting fucking AMPED about it.

P2 for humans is underway, its called courage.

It adresses the muscle wasting problem if glp1.  Pub med has articles on why this also accelerates strength when you do workout, to have the muscle mass available.

See examples of Myostatin defficiency in animals:

[Myostatin deficiency occurs in animals, humans etc.  It has no side effects typically except for increased caloric burn from the muscle mass.  Thus it was not evolutionarily beneficial to have so much muscle.](https://preview.redd.it/ytftwaq02hef1.png?width=468&format=png&auto=webp&s=eaea3d5cf0c39a9b05d81d354d1e0018f23c99a3)

üêØ Tiger Brokers ( $TIGR ) is clawing its way to the top of Oceania's digital brokerage jungle and it's doing it with haste, roaring fundamentals and stealth...  
  
üí°Simple thesis, if we just assume $TIGR is the worst broker, it still has the fundamentals supporting a double BUT I will also demonstrate by comparison why it is actually a crazy growth opportunity. You can even get hands on yourself without an account and explore some of the app- ‚û°Ô∏è Tiger Trade ‚¨ÖÔ∏è on the respective app store(s).

üìä OK, lets start with Fundamental Comparisons, I've made pretty pictures for you:  
  
$TIGR $HOOD $FUTU 

[Most importantly, the last chart, it has room to 5x the marketcap.](https://preview.redd.it/rf937nhdimef1.png?width=1661&format=png&auto=webp&s=8abf8a7a56e6ac772aa91c87f608bfce08144547)

# **Outrageously Undervalued.**



üí∏ Lets talk about cash flow Cash Flow. P/C (Price to Cash) = 0.5. Insane. $TIGR has so much cash that it's enterprise value is negative, that means if you bought all of $TIGR at its current market cap, including paying all its debt you would have more cash then you spent buying the company. How much would you profit? About 1.5 Billion (‚úåÔ∏èdouble-up) 



üõí This could also make it a potential target for acquisition, it has a smart team + tons of global regulatory approvals already. Meanwhile $HOOD has been working on Singapore approval for nearly a year now.



üç¥ $TIGR Q1 earnings was for the giant drawdown period and it still looked amazing. Since then we've had a jarringly fast recovery and new Crypto highs, expect Q2 to be a huge beat, analysts are out to lunch.



üéâ I think a **24%** surprise beat on revenue and **100%** beat on earnings.

\- Revenue/Earning Estimate      |   118M / $0.10

\- Revenue/Earnings Prediction   |   146M / $0.20



üò§ ""Yeah but-""

but what if $HOOD comes to Oceania? 

\- $HOOD is more expensive and doesn't actually have more features than $TIGR, it would be hard to convince people to switch who already use a platform just like $HOOD but pay much less for it. Admittedly Robinhood does have a better user experience and I would say their UI implementation is bar none the best for retail.



but $FUTU is bigger and safer!

\- It is bigger and safer annnnnd has less room to appreciate, already trading at a premium to $TIGR but I'd say its still undervalued as well. Both stocks move with each other fairly consistently, I just prefer the one with more reward for my risk. $TIGR can increase it's profit margin 2x and its user base (to a lesser degree) if it does that in 2026 the stock will trade at $40+.  



but if Trump delists China Stocks its fked!

\- $TIGR is based in Singapore. It serves clients in Singapore, Australia, New Zealand, China and even the US.



but you didn't show up $HOOD EPS Y/Y, its > 1000%, way more than any other broker!

\- Every company EPS looks amazing coming from NEGATIVE earnings, I provided the positive Q/Q.



but it already ran up!

\- Good stocks go up smh, I just posted all the reasons why it has so much more room, above, in picture form, for your smooth brain.



üí∞ Wealth Management = Sticky Growth

Tiger is leaning heavily into Wealth Management, adding high-quality revenue streams and stickiness. Think Schwab or IBKR, but at an earlier and cheaper stage. This is a great fit for the region which is now transitioning to stock investments at a higher rate due to turmoil over the last few decades in real-estate markets.

ü´∞ Massive valuation gap vs. peers. $TIGR could double and still look cheaper than all the competition.

TL;DR: You‚Äôre paying **cash value for an FDA-approved CNS-penetrant lung-cancer pill with 80 % margins**, **$660 M of liquidity** (2y run away), an **NCCN ‚Äòpreferred‚Äô tag** and the only biotech CEO who has already turned a single TKI into a $14 B exit‚Äîupside multiples range from 3√ó on execution to 10√ó on a take-out.

Why you, your wife, her lover should be investing in NUVB?  
**Nuvation Bio Inc.** is a clinical-stage biotechnology company based in the US. It's focus? **Oncology.**  
If you are like me, you probably didn't know what oncology was but in regard language they are just focusing on cancer studies.

When I say BIOtech you say? ""Which phase are we at for which drug""?  
\- talectrectinib (aka IBTROZI for the friends and family) just received full FDA approval (June 11 2025) for ROS1-positive non-small-cell lung cancer. Market reaction? Decent $NUVB grew by \~30% since then

And you know what's amazing? NUVB **trades around the low-single-digit dollar range** and currently has a market capitalisation of roughly **US $600 million**. I know, I know what a tiny one it is but she told me it's not the size that matters so we fine.

So we know that it trades at an historical low even after the run up post FDA so why the fuck should we invest in that shit?  
Incredible leadership. I mean look at this guy:

This isn't this guy first rodeo, he has been through it he previously built and sold Medivation (XTANDI¬Æ) to Pfizer even after a rough patch because of their phase 3 failure he was able to turn things around and bring a whopping 20x for its investors.

Not convinced yet? Look at the damn [CFO](https://www.crunchbase.com/person/philippe-sauvage). Yes he looks like a regard but he is a regard that been through it and his fucking name is Philippe Sauvage. Fuck if James Bond vilain doesn't make you want to invest, I don't know what will.

SMCI,2025-07-20,US,"Nvidia Will Continue Controlling The AI Board Nvidia is the 'queen' of the AI ecosystem, dominating hardware, software, and systems and controlling key segments from training to inference and networking.

Unmatched AI leadership, explosive revenue growth, and strategic partnerships with players like Astera Labs, Credo, and Super Micro Computer reinforce Nvidia's central role.

China market access and the Omniverse platform provide significant new growth drivers, supporting a strong 12-24 month growth outlook and a buy rating.

Despite high absolute valuation multiples, Nvidia's rapid growth and favorable PEG ratios make it attractive versus peers; the main risk is US-China geopolitical tension.

I believe these companies are well-positioned in the AI ecosystem, but I realise that one piece is missing: the queen. Just like in a game of chess, the queen is the most powerful and versatile piece on the board. It can move in any direction (horizontal, vertical, and diagonal) and quickly cover a wide area. That is why I believe it is a perfect fit for NVIDIA (NVDA). I say this because it dominates both offensively and defensively. Just as the queen controls most of the board, NVDA controls the most valuable parts of the AI infrastructure, from training to inference, simulation, and networking. Secondly, it is versatile and critical because it spans hardware, software, and systems. This is cool because few participants can match its breadth and influence. Finally, it leverages strategic partnerships. I mean, just as the queen commands pawns, rooks, and bishops, NVDA integrates system builders (such as Super Micro Computer (SMCI)), connectivity providers (such as Credo Technology Group (CRDO) and Astera Labs (ALAB)), and government AI programmes to expand its control over the AI battlefield.

So why is the queen so special?

Well, several factors set Nvidia apart. First and foremost, it holds an unparalleled leadership position in the AI field, thanks to the combination of hardware, software, and ecosystem advantages. Its Blackwell GPU architecture makes it uniquely special. Combined with the Omniverse simulation platform, we are driving self-reinforcing AI, which is driving explosive growth. For example, in the first quarter of the 2026 fiscal year, NVDA achieved revenue of $44.1 billion, representing a year over year increase of 69%. Data centre revenue reached $39.1 billion, up 73%. Some of Nvidia's key customers such as Microsoft , Google  OpenAI, and Meta  deploy tens of thousands of Nvidia's latest GPUs each quarter. For example, according to SA Weebler Finance data, hyperscale data centre operators are running approximately 1,000 NVLink rack systems (about 72,000 GPUs) per week, with further increases expected. Ideally, this means Nvidia's data centre run rate in the AI computing sector has exceeded $170 billion annually.

Secondly, NVDA's stack is also expanding beyond GPUs. As I mentioned, its global industrial simulation platform is now being used to digitise entire factories and cities. In fact, the platform has evolved to support critical infrastructure. Original equipment manufacturers like BMW are running over 30 virtual factories on the platform to optimise production in advance. As each AI solution requires an increasing amount of synthetic training data, NVDA's end-to-end solutions form an unparalleled moat. Ideally, this platform means more users generating more simulation data, ultimately driving demand for more Nvidia computing resources. What I see is that NVDA is now at the centre of the AI value chain.

Finally, the U.S. has approved the resumption of exports of NVIDIA H20 AI GPUs to China. This means NVIDIA will be able to access China's potential market, which is significant. According to a Morgan Stanley report, China's AI market is expected to reach $1.4 trillion by 2030.

China has been systematically implementing a long-term strategy to build its domestic artificial intelligence capabilities. Its strong academic foundation, innovative methods, data, talent, and growing foreign investment are driving it toward becoming a leading artificial intelligence powerhouse...

‚Äò...China is less concerned with building the most powerful AI capabilities and more focused on bringing AI to market. China embraces open-source AI, while the United States appears to be moving toward closed, tightly controlled AI systems...‚Äô

‚Äò...The next 6 to 12 months will be a critical period for Chinese AI companies, as more and more deployments aimed at solving real-world problems begin to demonstrate productivity gains.‚Äô

Due to this milestone, NVDA's Jensen Huang estimates that NVDA's potential market size  in China will reach $50 billion. This means that China's spending on AI will increase, and Nvidia's growth prospects are expected to be stronger than ever before. I expect this growth outlook to be reflected in the upcoming quarterly earnings report to be released on 27 August 2025.

These factors combined will undoubtedly accelerate Nvidia's growth trajectory over the next 12 to 24 months. Therefore, I assign a ‚ÄòBuy‚Äô rating to Nvidia Corporation.

Nvidia's AI Ecosystem

Having highlighted the case for NVDA, I would like to connect it to some AI components I have researched previously. Some of these AI companies have remarkable growth prospects and are expected to align their growth trajectories with NVDA. Additionally, the connections between NVDA and these AI companies will help us better understand NVDA's future direction.

First, Astera Labs  is a leading connectivity chip company that recently went public in 2024. ALAB's chips support scalable and low-latency GPU rack interconnects. For more information on Astera Labs and its chips, please refer to Article 1 and Article 2. Now, Nvidia has publicly announced its collaboration with Astera on NVLink Fusion. This collaboration expands NVDA's total addressable market (TAM).

There is also Credo Technology, which is known for its active cables  re-timers, and SerDes chips. According to SA Oakoff Investments, most hyperscale computing vendors now consider CRDO's AEC to be the de facto standard for in-rack links. This means that AEC cables are the infrastructure required for NVDA's 72-GPU Blackwell rack.

Third, Super Micro Computer  and Celestica  manufacture and sell GPU racks and systems using NVDA technology. Nvidia currently provides complete data centre racks containing tens of thousands of GPUs, which are delivered to system builders like SMCI and CLS. They then collaborate with NVDA to package and sell these racks to hyperscale customers such as Microsoft, Meta, and Amazon. For more information, please refer to this article from SMCI and this article from Celestica.

In summary, these partnerships demonstrate NVIDIA's connectivity within the AI ecosystem. This confirms that NVIDIA is indeed the queen of the AI chessboard.

For a company with a market capitalisation of 4.22 trillion dollars, it still has significant growth opportunities, particularly in the Chinese market, which means there is much to watch for with NVIDIA. Additionally, I note that NVIDIA has an A- growth rating, as shown in the figure below. The company's expected revenue growth rate is 60.71%, while the industry median is 7.28%. Furthermore, its 3-5 year compound annual growth rate  for expected long-term earnings per share  growth is 29.09%, compared to the industry median of 14.29%. This clearly indicates the expected growth levels for certain potential AI opportunities, such as the Omniverse platform and the Chinese AI market.

Now, when it comes to valuation, the growth outlook is becoming clearer. First, when I look at the chart below, I notice that most metrics are above the industry median, indicating that the valuation is higher than the industry median. Its non-GAAP forward price-to-earnings ratio is 40.12 times, and its forward enterprise value to EBITDA ratio is 34.79 times, both significantly higher than the industry median. However, when I look at the non-GAAP forward price-to-earnings ratio , it indicates that the valuation is undervalued by 27%. NVDA's price-to-earnings ratio is 1.38 times, while the industry median is 1.90 times. Based on the GAAP trailing 12-month PEG, the company's P/E ratio is 0.69 times, undervalued by 31% compared to the industry median. Ideally, I would say that most multiples look high in absolute terms, but compared to NVDA's 60.71% compound annual growth rate, the stock's valuation isn't as high as it appears.

In terms of peer comparison, I chose NVDA's closest competitors because Nvidia is already far ahead in terms of market capitalisation, so I chose Broadcom and AMD. I noticed that NVDA's price-to-earnings ratio and expected price-to-earnings ratio are still lower than its peers.

I believe that the biggest risk facing NVIDIA at present is geopolitical risk. Currently, there are many uncertainties between China and the United States, especially following the imposition of tariffs on Liberation Day and the U.S. government's decision to suspend exports of H20 GPUs to China. Such situations could recur and undermine NVIDIA's growth plans and market expansion efforts. Losing the Chinese market would have a significant impact on NVIDIA's business. Additionally, geopolitical events such as trade tariffs and sanctions could affect global supply or cloud computing spending in some of the key regions where NVIDIA operates. In conclusion, in this grand AI infrastructure game, NVIDIA is the queen. Currently, it is the most powerful and flexible piece on the board. Compared to peers that may occupy other key positions, NVIDIA controls every direction. For example, AMD is the rook, SMCI is the bishop, while Credo and Astera are agile knights. Ultimately, NVIDIA determines the pace and scope of this game. As AI demand continues to grow, NVIDIA's dominant position is further strengthened by the expansion of the Chinese market. || Nvidia Will Continue Controlling The AI Board Nvidia is the 'queen' of the AI ecosystem, dominating hardware, software, and systems and controlling key segments from training to inference and networking.

Additionally, I note that NVIDIA has an A- growth rating, as shown in the figure below. The company's expected revenue growth rate is 60.71%, while the industry median is 7.28%. Furthermore, its 3-5 year compound annual growth rate  for expected long-term earnings per share  growth is 29.09%, compared to the industry median of 14.29%. This clearly indicates the expected growth levels for certain potential AI opportunities, such as the Omniverse platform and the Chinese AI market.

Now, when it comes to valuation, the growth outlook is becoming clearer. First, when I look at the chart below, I notice that most metrics are above the industry median, indicating that the valuation is higher than the industry median. Its non-GAAP forward price-to-earnings ratio is 40.12 times, and its forward enterprise value to EBITDA ratio is 34.79 times, both significantly higher than the industry median. However, when I look at the non-GAAP forward price-to-earnings ratio , it indicates that the valuation is undervalued by 27%. NVDA's price-to-earnings ratio is 1.38 times, while the industry median is 1.90 times. Based on the GAAP trailing 12-month PEG, the company's P/E ratio is 0.69 times, undervalued by 31% compared to the industry median. Ideally, I would say that most multiples look high in absolute terms, but compared to NVDA's 60.71% compound annual growth rate, the stock's valuation isn't as high as it appears.

In terms of peer comparison, I chose NVDA's closest competitors because Nvidia is already far ahead in terms of market capitalisation, so I chose Broadcom and AMD. I noticed that NVDA's price-to-earnings ratio and expected price-to-earnings ratio are still lower than its peers.

I believe that the biggest risk facing NVIDIA at present is geopolitical risk. Currently, there are many uncertainties between China and the United States, especially following the imposition of tariffs on Liberation Day and the U.S. government's decision to suspend exports of H20 GPUs to China. Such situations could recur and undermine NVIDIA's growth plans and market expansion efforts. Losing the Chinese market would have a significant impact on NVIDIA's business. Additionally, geopolitical events such as trade tariffs and sanctions could affect global supply or cloud computing spending in some of the key regions where NVIDIA operates. In conclusion, in this grand AI infrastructure game, NVIDIA is the queen. Currently, it is the most powerful and flexible piece on the board. Compared to peers that may occupy other key positions, NVIDIA controls every direction. For example, AMD is the rook, SMCI is the bishop, while Credo and Astera are agile knights. Ultimately, NVIDIA determines the pace and scope of this game. As AI demand continues to grow, NVIDIA's dominant position is further strengthened by the expansion of the Chinese market. || Nvidia Will Continue Controlling The AI Board Nvidia is the 'queen' of the AI ecosystem, dominating hardware, software, and systems and controlling key segments from training to inference and networking.

Unmatched AI leadership, explosive revenue growth, and strategic partnerships with players like Astera Labs, Credo, and Super Micro Computer reinforce Nvidia's central role.

China market access and the Omniverse platform provide significant new growth drivers, supporting a strong 12-24 month growth outlook and a buy rating.

Despite high absolute valuation multiples, Nvidia's rapid growth and favorable PEG ratios make it attractive versus peers; the main risk is US-China geopolitical tension.

I believe these companies are well-positioned in the AI ecosystem, but I realise that one piece is missing: the queen. Just like in a game of chess, the queen is the most powerful and versatile piece on the board. It can move in any direction (horizontal, vertical, and diagonal) and quickly cover a wide area. That is why I believe it is a perfect fit for NVIDIA (NVDA). I say this because it dominates both offensively and defensively. Just as the queen controls most of the board, NVDA controls the most valuable parts of the AI infrastructure, from training to inference, simulation, and networking. Secondly, it is versatile and critical because it spans hardware, software, and systems. This is cool because few participants can match its breadth and influence. Finally, it leverages strategic partnerships. I mean, just as the queen commands pawns, rooks, and bishops, NVDA integrates system builders (such as Super Micro Computer (SMCI)), connectivity providers (such as Credo Technology Group (CRDO) and Astera Labs (ALAB)), and government AI programmes to expand its control over the AI battlefield.

So why is the queen so special?

Well, several factors set Nvidia apart. First and foremost, it holds an unparalleled leadership position in the AI field, thanks to the combination of hardware, software, and ecosystem advantages. Its Blackwell GPU architecture makes it uniquely special. Combined with the Omniverse simulation platform, we are driving self-reinforcing AI, which is driving explosive growth. For example, in the first quarter of the 2026 fiscal year, NVDA achieved revenue of $44.1 billion, representing a year over year increase of 69%. Data centre revenue reached $39.1 billion, up 73%. Some of Nvidia's key customers such as Microsoft , Google  OpenAI, and Meta  deploy tens of thousands of Nvidia's latest GPUs each quarter. For example, according to SA Weebler Finance data, hyperscale data centre operators are running approximately 1,000 NVLink rack systems (about 72,000 GPUs) per week, with further increases expected. Ideally, this means Nvidia's data centre run rate in the AI computing sector has exceeded $170 billion annually.

Secondly, NVDA's stack is also expanding beyond GPUs. As I mentioned, its global industrial simulation platform is now being used to digitise entire factories and cities. In fact, the platform has evolved to support critical infrastructure. Original equipment manufacturers like BMW are running over 30 virtual factories on the platform to optimise production in advance. As each AI solution requires an increasing amount of synthetic training data, NVDA's end-to-end solutions form an unparalleled moat. Ideally, this platform means more users generating more simulation data, ultimately driving demand for more Nvidia computing resources. What I see is that NVDA is now at the centre of the AI value chain.

Finally, the U.S. has approved the resumption of exports of NVIDIA H20 AI GPUs to China. This means NVIDIA will be able to access China's potential market, which is significant. According to a Morgan Stanley report, China's AI market is expected to reach $1.4 trillion by 2030.

China has been systematically implementing a long-term strategy to build its domestic artificial intelligence capabilities. Its strong academic foundation, innovative methods, data, talent, and growing foreign investment are driving it toward becoming a leading artificial intelligence powerhouse...

‚Äò...China is less concerned with building the most powerful AI capabilities and more focused on bringing AI to market. China embraces open-source AI, while the United States appears to be moving toward closed, tightly controlled AI systems...‚Äô

‚Äò...The next 6 to 12 months will be a critical period for Chinese AI companies, as more and more deployments aimed at solving real-world problems begin to demonstrate productivity gains.‚Äô

Due to this milestone, NVDA's Jensen Huang estimates that NVDA's potential market size  in China will reach $50 billion. This means that China's spending on AI will increase, and Nvidia's growth prospects are expected to be stronger than ever before. I expect this growth outlook to be reflected in the upcoming quarterly earnings report to be released on 27 August 2025.

These factors combined will undoubtedly accelerate Nvidia's growth trajectory over the next 12 to 24 months. Therefore, I assign a ‚ÄòBuy‚Äô rating to Nvidia Corporation.

Nvidia's AI Ecosystem

Having highlighted the case for NVDA, I would like to connect it to some AI components I have researched previously. Some of these AI companies have remarkable growth prospects and are expected to align their growth trajectories with NVDA. Additionally, the connections between NVDA and these AI companies will help us better understand NVDA's future direction.

First, Astera Labs  is a leading connectivity chip company that recently went public in 2024. ALAB's chips support scalable and low-latency GPU rack interconnects. For more information on Astera Labs and its chips, please refer to Article 1 and Article 2. Now, Nvidia has publicly announced its collaboration with Astera on NVLink Fusion. This collaboration expands NVDA's total addressable market (TAM).

There is also Credo Technology, which is known for its active cables  re-timers, and SerDes chips. According to SA Oakoff Investments, most hyperscale computing vendors now consider CRDO's AEC to be the de facto standard for in-rack links. This means that AEC cables are the infrastructure required for NVDA's 72-GPU Blackwell rack.

Third, Super Micro Computer  and Celestica  manufacture and sell GPU racks and systems using NVDA technology. Nvidia currently provides complete data centre racks containing tens of thousands of GPUs, which are delivered to system builders like SMCI and CLS. They then collaborate with NVDA to package and sell these racks to hyperscale customers such as Microsoft, Meta, and Amazon. For more information, please refer to this article from SMCI and this article from Celestica.

In summary, these partnerships demonstrate NVIDIA's connectivity within the AI ecosystem. This confirms that NVIDIA is indeed the queen of the AI chessboard.

And earnings will continue to decline going into rate-cuts. The market appears to be calling ""Trump's bluff"" on tariffs, and not behaving rationally. It made sense in February 2025 that we could go a bit higher. And that the April sell off was an over reaction.

But now this is just becoming banana-zone ridiculous blow-off top status in everything.

Southern Company is trading almost at a 50 year low on dividend yield, which is nonsense because Southern Company has NOTHING to do with the ""electricity utility Ai thesis"" that is supposedly driving the high valuations in Utility companies. Instead we are just in an ""everything bubble"" where valuations are absurd and has nothing to do with Ai or Bitcoin or ""cash on the side"" or anything.

It's a classic blow-off top leading into rate cuts. Which means it's more likely to do with Dealer hedging which drags price higher in this case. 

I just moved all my CCJ uranium affiliate over to Bonds (TMF and TLTW specifically). I didn't even wait 1 month for the ""long term capital gains"" because I think in 1 month CCJ will reverse and bonds will rally, negating all the savings a long term capital gain would trigger.

The market usually times itself like that, and because August/September was a good time to buy, CCJ is bound for a crash into August/September as the market denies long-term holders an exit.

Easy trap if you ask me.

As for the broader market. SPY to top out into August makes sense so I'm continuing to add shorts on SPY, SO and KO. My break evens using options are still above the current prices of all three so that's a good short.

I'll add to oil shorts and XLE shorts when the front months start to roll off for me.

T,2025-07-18,US,"Understanding Your Next Play in Critical Minerals (DD) Hi all,

I wanted to touch base to tell you all about how I‚Äôve been considering new fund allocations across the sector, especially given that we have begun to see sizable upside. I also wanted to point out a potential catalyst across the industry broadly, but especially for particular minerals and rare earths.

**I. DASH, FAST-41, and YOU, a primer**

The federal government has a initiative called the **Defense Authorization for Strategic and High‚ÄëTech.**¬†Speaking in terms of minerals initiative‚Äîit presents as an¬†**investment/funding program**¬†linked to the DoD (and also relevant to DPA, DOE) aimed at accelerating U.S. supply chains in critical minerals (like graphite, rare earths, etc.). It focuses on¬†**grants, offtake agreements, and financial backing.**¬†They also have a dashboard called FAST-41. This is primarily for permitting and regulatory approvals related to infrastructure, including mining and critical minerals.

As we have seen with¬†[the recent MP <-> Pentagon deal](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/07/10/pentagon-to-become-largest-shareholder-in-rare-earth-magnet-maker-mp-materials.html), the US government isn‚Äôt joking around about providing significant backing to promising rare earth and critical minerals companies that process, mine, and develop product domestically. They have¬†[outright said it themselves](https://www.reuters.com/world/china/pentagon-keep-working-with-us-rare-earths-projects-us-defense-official-says-2025-07-15/)¬†\- they are aiming to provide more funding, and fast.

We can use DASH and FAST-41 to our advantage to help us make investment choices as this run extends across the industry. I expect further DoD funding to trickle in within the next few weeks. Here are some compelling contenders for federal funding and incentivization, analyzed by their relationship with the federal government (existing contracts, speculation, FAST designation, or beyond).

>**UCORE Rare Metals (UURAF)**: Strategically placed with exposure to both US and Canadian government investments, this company has compelling technology for the separation of Heavy Rare Earths.¬†[They have recently been awarded a DoD grant](https://ucore.com/ucore-launches-us-department-of-defense-funded-18-4-million-commercial-rare-earth-refining-project/).

>**Energy Fuels (UUUU)**: As both a uranium producer and a producer of rare earth oxides¬†[(most recently announcing heavy rare earth oxide production)](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/energy-fuels-now-producing-heavy-104500195.html), this company is well-poised for significant government investment.

>**American Battery Technology (ABAT)**: Leading in battery recycling, this company has relationships with big names like TESLA and ties to federal funds.

>**Graphite One (GPHOF):**¬†This company has the potential to be come a vertically integrated graphite source. China‚Äôs grip over graphite processing is equally as dominant as their grip over rare earth processing.

>**WestWater Resources (WWR):**¬†Also a graphite producer, this company is well-poised for support from Washington.¬†[Recently, the administration announced import tariffs on graphite anode from China.](https://www.reuters.com/world/china/us-commerce-dept-sets-935-anti-dumping-tariff-chinese-anode-graphite-2025-07-17/#:~:text=July%2017%20(Reuters)%20%2D%20The,less%20than%20fair%20market%20value.)¬†That‚Äôs big news.

>**Lithium Americas (LAC):**¬†North America‚Äôs largest lithium deposit with big name partnerships¬†[(e.g. GM invested $650 million dollars into it](https://lithiumamericas.com/news/news-details/2024/Unlocking-Thacker-Pass-General-Motors-to-Contribute-Combined-625-Million-in-Cash-and-Letters-of-Credit-to-New-Joint-Venture-with-Lithium-Americas/default.aspx)). This one is as obvious a play as I have ever seen.

>**The Metals Company (TMC):**¬†High risk, high reward. They are awaiting permitting news in the next few months. Unprecedented plan to retrieve minerals from the ocean floor.

I also continue to believe in further upside at¬†**MP materials,**¬†despite their already magnificent run and news.

**II. Import Tariffs via Section 232**

In April, T[rump initiated a Section 232 investigation into the national security threat that critical minerals pose](https://www.whitehouse.gov/fact-sheets/2025/04/fact-sheet-president-donald-j-trump-ensures-national-security-and-economic-resilience-through-section-232-actions-on-processed-critical-minerals-and-derivative-products/).¬†[Likewise as with Copper,](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trump-announces-50-tariff-copper-effective-august-1-2025-07-10/)¬†and as we have seen with Graphite just yesterday (linked above), we are likely to see tariffs roll out on further minerals by way of this investigation. After the report is completed, Trump will have a short amount of time to decide whether to impose tariffs or not on the industry.

Which minerals, though? Theoretically, most of them, as they all are strategic to defense. However, our production capacity is not high for certain areas yet (e.g. heavy rare earths), so what will happen exactly is not known to me entirely.

That being said, we know that the administration is not afraid of stepping up to China boldly, nor are they afraid of import controls and tariffs. This is an area to watch carefully. I expect announcements in the next weeks to months, if not sooner.

Lithium in particular stands out to me. Chinese price-gouging of the spot price has made it almost impossible for domestic producers to be able to compete. Take that information as you wish!

That‚Äôs all for now folks.

 || Alright regards buckle up, we've OPEN the door now we do a value play with $NUVB *this isn't financial advice, i am just a regard that loves stocks*

TL;DR: You‚Äôre paying **cash value for an FDA-approved CNS-penetrant lung-cancer pill with 80 % margins**, **$660 M of liquidity** (2y run away), an **NCCN ‚Äòpreferred‚Äô tag** and the only biotech CEO who has already turned a single TKI into a $14 B exit‚Äîupside multiples range from 3√ó on execution to 10√ó on a take-out.

Why you, your wife, her lover should be investing in NUVB?  
**Nuvation Bio Inc.** is a clinical-stage biotechnology company based in the US. It's focus? **Oncology.**  
If you are like me, you probably didn't know what oncology was but in regard language they are just focusing on cancer studies.

When I say BIOtech you say? ""Which phase are we at for which drug""?  
\- talectrectinib (aka IBTROZI for the friends and family) just received full FDA approval (June 11 2025) for ROS1-positive non-small-cell lung cancer. Market reaction? Decent $NUVB grew by \~30% since then

And you know what's amazing? NUVB **trades around the low-single-digit dollar range** and currently has a market capitalisation of roughly **US $600 million**. I know, I know what a tiny one it is but she told me it's not the size that matters so we fine.

So we know that it trades at an historical low even after the run up post FDA so why the fuck should we invest in that shit?  
Incredible leadership. I mean look at this guy:

[David T Hung, CEO of NUVB](https://preview.redd.it/v7v95xljoodf1.png?width=248&format=png&auto=webp&s=6438b90616473c76a5018bffa9e51a57155a5691)

Don't you see what I see? fuck you regard, you want me cancel but I won't say it just watch this video [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FoYC\_8cutb0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FoYC_8cutb0) and come back

This isn't this guy first rodeo, he has been through it he previously built and sold Medivation (XTANDI¬Æ) to Pfizer even after a rough patch because of their phase 3 failure he was able to turn things around and bring a whopping 20x for its investors.

Not convinced yet? Look at the damn [CFO](https://www.crunchbase.com/person/philippe-sauvage). Yes he looks like a regard but he is a regard that been through it and his fucking name is Philippe Sauvage. Fuck if James Bond vilain doesn't make you want to invest, I don't know what will.

**Seasoned leadership** that have barely sold any stocks since the start of the company, heck they bought a shit ton of it.

The buying **increased by a lot** in the last year

And yes David and Sauvage have been **deep** in it (no pun intended)

Hedge funds are in it too, BlackRock increased its position

**Competition**? 18 Jun 2025 NCCN update places IBTROZI as a **Preferred option in every treatment line** and **explicitly for brain mets & post-crizotinib resistance**.

Balance sheet?

\- **$462 M cash** (Mar-25).  
\- **$200 M Sagard royalty + debt** already drawn  
**- Zero use of the $200 M ATM to date.**

They can expand without any foreseable dillution.

Key events?

This people are not casually running through a marathon, **they are sprinting**:

**-** Early shipments start July-25 (triggers $50 M Sagard tranche).  
**-** Q2 call 6 Aug-25 ‚Äì first script numbers & 2025 guidance.  
**-** WCLC Sept + ESMO Oct ‚Äì long-term CNS & RWE data.  
\- Japan approval decision Dec-25.

The play?

Bought some long dated options but have been increasing my shares positions in my account that has not been restricted to penny stock.  
In total I have \~**40k+ invested in NUVB** across multiple accounts and I am DCA-ing so keep an eye on it.

Look at every single tech market where Alphabet is the dominant player or is in the top three.  In many instances, GOOGL created the market or disrupted the market incumbent.  It just emerged a few months ago that quantum computing was a thing; and which company had the breakthrough? Alphabet.  (Full Disclosure: I own 800 shares of GOOGL/GOOG and a child who works there)

My original plan was to roll the funds through short term T-bills while attending school which would be risk free and yield decent returns. However, I'm exploring the idea of allocating the remaining $64k (after paying for the first year) into one or two solid companies that could see solid upside in the next 2/3 years. If everything goes well, I would then liquidate a portion of the position for each payment period (after 1 year). The school provides 4 payment periods throughout each semester thankfully.

I‚Äôm mainly considering large-cap names that I believe are either fairly valued or potentially undervalued. AAPL, GOOGL, and LLY are on my radar. MSFT is also in the mix as a durable compounder. I‚Äôm intentionally avoiding anything too speculative or volatile (like TSLA or NVDA), and I‚Äôm not looking at mid-cap or high-beta plays.

Are there any companies this community sees as fitting into this plan or should I likely stick with fixed income? I would greatly appreciate any insights or ideas on where you‚Äôd look if you were in a similar situation.

AI response:

As of my latest knowledge, Kewsong Lee, the former CEO of The Carlyle Group, has not been confirmed as a billionaire. While he held a high-profile leadership role at one of the world's largest private equity firms, his exact net worth is not publicly disclosed in major billionaire rankings like Forbes or Bloomberg.

Key Points:
- Carlyle Group Tenure: Lee served as co-CEO (2017‚Äì2020) and then sole CEO (2020‚Äì2022) before stepping down. His compensation likely included significant salary, bonuses, and carried interest, but exact figures are private.
- Previous Roles: Before Carlyle, he was a senior executive at Warburg Pincus, another major PE firm, which may have contributed to his wealth.
- Net Worth Estimate: While he is undoubtedly wealthy, most estimates suggest his net worth is in the hundreds of millions rather than billions. Private equity executives often accumulate substantial wealth, but reaching billionaire status typically requires ownership stakes or exceptional investment returns.

If his net worth has recently crossed into billionaire territory, it hasn‚Äôt been widely reported. For the most current data, check recent financial disclosures or Forbes/Bloomberg updates.

I‚Äôm mainly considering large-cap names that I believe are either fairly valued or potentially undervalued. AAPL, GOOGL, and LLY are on my radar. MSFT is also in the mix as a durable compounder. I‚Äôm intentionally avoiding anything too speculative or volatile (like TSLA or NVDA), and I‚Äôm not looking at mid-cap or high-beta plays.

Are there any companies this community sees as fitting into this plan or should I likely stick with fixed income? I would greatly appreciate any insights or ideas on where you‚Äôd look if you were in a similar situation.

TSLA,2025-07-24,US,"TSLA Q2 Takeaways Cautious Near-Term Bold Long-Term Tesla just reported Q2 earnings which unsurprisingly gave the market a lot to think about 

EPS was $0.40 non-GAAP vs Bank of America's estimate of $0.35 so technically it a beat on expectations Energy and better auto margins brought strong results but the picture is clearly more nuanced 

 Bank of America says it was slightly better than expected but also points to downsides from weaker electric car incentives and weaker tariffs have been a downside they're neutral honestly it hard to argue with that in the short term

Morgan Stanley points out Tesla balancing act Tesla is trying to cross the full autopilot FSD chasm while struggling with slowing deliveries and capex for the moon project 

Barclays is sceptical warning the gap between rhetoric and fundamentals is widening it is A polite way of saying that the FSD hype has yet to be backed by execution 

Stifel are also neutral but they highlight the upcoming FSD v12 release and Austin Taxi expansion as green shoots

Piper Sandler always bullish, called it a solid quarter and questioned the after-hours selloff seeming less concerned about the short-term noise seeing FSD's potential trumping everything else

This was a vision vs reality type of quarter Tesla ambitions for AI and Autopilot are still intact but will take years to realise and in the meantime fundamental demand, margins, and regulatory headwinds remain the top priorities

Tesla‚Äôs second-quarter earnings came in a bit under expectations, and the stock saw some volatility in after-hours trading. While the company still remains a leader in the EV space, the market seems to be questioning its next moves.

The big headline? Tesla is still pushing ahead with its plans for a ""more affordable"" model, set to start production in late 2025. While no exact details were revealed, this could be a game-changer if Tesla can hit that $30,000 price point. Investors are curious to see how this new vehicle will stack up against competitors in an increasingly crowded EV market.

And then there‚Äôs the robotaxi. Testing is ramping up in Austin, and Tesla‚Äôs still aiming to roll out a driverless ride-hailing service by 2026. This futuristic vision keeps fans excited, but the reality of these vehicles actually hitting the road is still a few years away.

Of course, there‚Äôs the looming expiration of the $7,500 EV tax credit, which Tesla‚Äôs CFO said might cause some delivery delays in the second half of the year. Musk himself admitted that the company could face a rough patch once those incentives go away.

The bigger question for investors? With sales slipping, especially in Europe, and competition heating up, can Tesla keep its growth momentum going? Or is it facing a tougher road ahead?

Tesla has always been a controversial company. New affordable electric cars and robot cabs are exciting, but they're a long way off The short-term challenges facing Tesla, from expiring tax breaks to sluggish global sales, are no small hurdle.

I'm cautiously optimistic about Tesla's long-term future. How long can the company maintain its leadership position in the electric vehicle space?  || I guess it is finally time to short $TSLA I've been following Tesla for a long time, and have been losing money trying to take bearish positions on TSLA.

But there's an enormous difference just among the top 10 tech stocks by size.

TSLA is trading at a PE of 177 which doesn't make the remotest bit of sense based on the business that they are in (cars) and could be in (robotaxis, robots, and AI), even if they were wildly successful in new business areas (in which they face stiff competition) there is no way to justify the current valuation.

PLTR's PE is over 600 not much more I need to say about that.

GOOG is trading at a PE of 21. Its core search business is going to be disrupted by AI but it is still entrenched and they have the time and resources to adapt. Meanwhile they own the largest streaming platform in YouTube, and arguably the most actually successful robotaxi business in Waymo. If they were ever split up the parts would be worth far more than the sum.

AAPL's heyday is behind it since their growth is anchored in devices and they will probably never acquire significantly more market share in phones meanwhile they have to create a new Fortune 500 sized business every year just to try to keep the growth going.

AMZN on the other hand is not bound by any particular industry or market. They are getting into satellites, pharmaceutical delivery, health care, and can pick any large market they want to address.

MSFT's new leadership after the atrocious Ballmer has brought the company into huge new markets and they are well positioned to capitalize on AI, with a PE of 39 they are not cheap but by far not the most expensive with solid growth prospects.

I personally think that social media is a scourge upon the earth and is destroying the minds of young and old people alike, but META has essentially monopolies that will not be disrupted. 

Meanwhile these companies are investing nearly $300 billion in cap ex per year and have returned nearly $1 trillion to shareholders in buybacks and dividends over the past 5 years.

Uber (UBER.N), opens new tab will invest $300 million in electric vehicle maker Lucid (LCID.O), opens new tab in a robotaxi deal that aims to start with one major U.S. city late next year, the companies said on Thursday.
Over six years starting in 2026, Uber will acquire and deploy over 20,000 Lucid Gravity SUVs that will be equipped with autonomous vehicle (AV) technology from startup Nuro, the three companies said in a statement.


The agreement illustrates the renewed plans and push for financing for self-driving cabs years after a first wave of autonomous driving investment produced only a limited number of vehicles. Tesla has recently launched a robotaxi trial in Austin and Alphabet's (GOOGL.O), opens new tab driverless taxi unit Waymo is speeding up its expansion.
As part of their announced deal, Uber will invest hundreds of millions of dollars in Lucid and Nuro, which supplies self-driving technology to automakers, the joint statement said. Of that, $300 million will go to Lucid, the EV maker said in a separate filing to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on Thursday.

**2Q 2025 Setup for beat**

|Diluted EPS|**$3.90**|$4.10‚ÄØ‚Äì‚ÄØ5.00|**$9.7**|

Reasons for divergence from street forecast:

\-Analyst used prevailing crack spreads in May, did not capture crack spikes in June for gasoline and especially diesel, which were about $3-5 higher.

\-USGC refiners, especially Valero, use a high mix of discounted heavy crudes such as Mexican Maya. These run on the order of $10 discounts to benchmark crude prices and aren't accounted in models

\-Valero's top tier refining operations easily pivots between refining cuts, letting them quickly capture elevated diesel cracks that emerged towards the end of the quarter

\-Valero owns their export docks making their sizable exports materially cheaper than peers.

**3Q 2025 Guidance and Beyond**

Cracks are even higher today pushing near $30, and likely setup to increase further with Gulf hurricane season and refinery maintenance season upon us. Extreme weather this summer has increased diesel burn to buffer stressed electricity grids, and diesel inventory stocks are far below baseline all around the Atlantic Basin. Despite the amazing refining profits to be made in this environment, refineries around the Atlantic Basin have actually been **shutting down** due to an unfortunate variety of idiosyncratic factors:

**\_\_\_**

\-UK Lindsey refinery shutting down **right now,** despite being highly profitable at today's cracks, due to corporate malfeasance putting refinery into bankruptcy administration

\-UK Grangemouth and LyondellBasell's Houston refineries both shut down earlier this year despite high cracks. Many refineries in EU are skipping capex, cutting capacity due to high costs all around.

**EU refinery losses are a structural tailwind for USGC refiners like Valero who can easily ship product across the Atlantic.**

**\_\_\_**

\-PEMEX refineries in Mexico are running far below nameplate capacity due to lack of maintenance. PEMEX has stiffed contractors, including refinery EPCs, on the order of $20 billion in unpaid bills; they aren't fixing up their refineries anytime soon due to debts and contractor distrust. Many PEMEX refineries are past maintenance dates and essentially on a run to failure model with high risk of unplanned, permanent outages.

\-Many LATAM refineries have same issues as PEMEX, refineries far past maintenance dates, a history of stiffing contractors, and no cash to pay up contractors. Ecuador's Esmeraldas¬†refinery has been completely shut down since May due to earthquake and fire damage; they still haven't been able to contract repairs for the refinery blocks.

\-Petrobas is well funded, but their Brazilian refineries are also long overdue for turnaround maintenance, scheduled for the next few months. This shuts down even more Atlantic Basin refining capacity right when cracks are juiciest.

**LATAM refinery shutdowns are bullish for Valero because it means these markets, especially Mexico, will continue devouring product from USGC refiners, and frees up cheap crudes like Mexican Maya for USGC refiners as well.**

**\_\_\_**

\-Ukraine, Russia, Israel and Iran may not agree on much except blowing up each other's refineries, all the easier with today's cheap FPV drones. Recent refinery casualties include Bazan, Tabriz, Kremenchuk, Lysychansk, Ryazan‚ÄØ, and Volgograd

\-War all around is another tailwind for refining product demand, especially diesel to fuel heavy military vehicles like tanks and backup generators when power grids are sabotaged

**Refinery casualties from these conflicts all tighten product balances in the Mediterranean, yet another export destination for USGC refiners like Valero that are just a short hop across the Atlantic.**

**\_\_\_**

**Bottom Line**

I'm bullish for tomorrow's earnings report simply due to the hard numbers penciling out a material beat. I'm bullish long term due to a combination of structural factors that knock out their competition across the Atlantic Basin, leaving juicy profits for the prime, export-oriented USGC refiner that is Valero.

|$VLO Report Forecast|2Q‚ÄØ25|3Q‚ÄØ25 (Guidance)|**FY‚ÄØ25 (base case)**|

Reasons for divergence from street forecast:

\-Analyst used prevailing crack spreads in May, did not capture crack spikes in June for gasoline and especially diesel, which were about $3-5 higher.

\-USGC refiners, especially Valero, use a high mix of discounted heavy crudes such as Mexican Maya. These run on the order of $10 discounts to benchmark crude prices and aren't accounted in models

\-Valero's top tier refining operations easily pivots between refining cuts, letting them quickly capture elevated diesel cracks that emerged towards the end of the quarter

\-Valero owns their export docks making their sizable exports materially cheaper than peers.

**3Q 2025 Guidance and Beyond**

Cracks are even higher today pushing near $30, and likely setup to increase further with Gulf hurricane season and refinery maintenance season upon us. Extreme weather this summer has increased diesel burn to buffer stressed electricity grids, and diesel inventory stocks are far below baseline all around the Atlantic Basin. Despite the amazing refining profits to be made in this environment, refineries around the Atlantic Basin have actually been **shutting down** due to an unfortunate variety of idiosyncratic factors:

**\_\_\_**

\-UK Lindsey refinery shutting down **right now,** despite being highly profitable at today's cracks, due to corporate malfeasance putting refinery into bankruptcy administration

\-UK Grangemouth and LyondellBasell's Houston refineries both shut down earlier this year despite high cracks. Many refineries in EU are skipping capex, cutting capacity due to high costs all around.

**EU refinery losses are a structural tailwind for USGC refiners like Valero who can easily ship product across the Atlantic.**

**\_\_\_**

\-PEMEX refineries in Mexico are running far below nameplate capacity due to lack of maintenance. PEMEX has stiffed contractors, including refinery EPCs, on the order of $20 billion in unpaid bills; they aren't fixing up their refineries anytime soon due to debts and contractor distrust. Many PEMEX refineries are past maintenance dates and essentially on a run to failure model with high risk of unplanned, permanent outages.

\-Many LATAM refineries have same issues as PEMEX, refineries far past maintenance dates, a history of stiffing contractors, and no cash to pay up contractors. Ecuador's Esmeraldas¬†refinery has been completely shut down since May due to earthquake and fire damage; they still haven't been able to contract repairs for the refinery blocks.

\-Petrobas is well funded, but their Brazilian refineries are also long overdue for turnaround maintenance, scheduled for the next few months. This shuts down even more Atlantic Basin refining capacity right when cracks are juiciest.

**LATAM refinery shutdowns are bullish for Valero because it means these markets, especially Mexico, will continue devouring product from USGC refiners, and frees up cheap crudes like Mexican Maya for USGC refiners as well.**

**\_\_\_**

\-Ukraine, Russia, Israel and Iran may not agree on much except blowing up each other's refineries, all the easier with today's cheap FPV drones. Recent refinery casualties include Bazan, Tabriz, Kremenchuk, Lysychansk, Ryazan‚ÄØ, and Volgograd

\-War all around is another tailwind for refining product demand, especially diesel to fuel heavy military vehicles like tanks and backup generators when power grids are sabotaged

**Refinery casualties from these conflicts all tighten product balances in the Mediterranean, yet another export destination for USGC refiners like Valero that are just a short hop across the Atlantic.**

**\_\_\_**

**Bottom Line**

I'm bullish for tomorrow's earnings report simply due to the hard numbers penciling out a material beat. I'm bullish long term due to a combination of structural factors that knock out their competition across the Atlantic Basin, leaving juicy profits for the prime, export-oriented USGC refiner that is Valero.

Today's pre-market index gains, especially in Nasdaq futures, reflect the market's expectations for tech stocks. Here are four stock moves I'm watching:



üîπ Microsoft (MSFT): down 0.3% premarket as SharePoint software was revealed to be under ‚Äúactive attack‚Äù. The software is widely used within government and business. Microsoft has issued a security patch, but the incident may have a short-term impact on customer confidence.



üîπ Verizon (VZ): Shares up 4.6% premarket after Q2 results beat estimates and raised the lower end of its full-year profit estimate range to 1%-3%. Strong wireless service revenue growth and healthy customer base expansion. Adjusted EPS of $1.22 beat estimates.



üîπ Alaska Airlines (ALK): up 0.9% premarket. Operations have now resumed despite a nationwide flight suspension due to an IT outage. Both the company and its subsidiaries have suffered recent cybersecurity incidents, which may prompt them to step up their IT investments in the future.



üîπ Equinix (EQIX): 2.5% pre-market gain after activist investor Elliott adds stake. Elliott has reportedly become one of the top 10 shareholders in EQIX. The company is a data center REIT with potential long-term upside in AI data processing needs.



üìä Personal view:



For Microsoft, this security incident may be a stock price disruptor in the short term, but the long term still needs to look at its cloud services and AI deployment capabilities.



Verizon's fundamentals are solid and its valuation remains attractive, especially against the backdrop of a high dividend yield.



Structural revaluation opportunities may exist in EQIX if it continues to get a boost from activist investors.



üí¨ Position Disclosure: There are currently no positions in any of the above stocks; consider taking a position in EQIX or VZ in the coming week. || Verizon Beats Estimates, Microsoft in Security Crisis, Equinix Gets Aggressive Buy as Tech Earnings Week Begins This week's market focus will be on big tech company earnings reports.
